<h1 title="">AGENT NINE AND THE
<br>JEWEL MYSTERY</h1>
<p class="center">★</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter I</span></span>
<br>AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob Houston, the youngest agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, stepped
out of the Department of Justice Building
and turned toward home, his heart beating faster
than it had in months. It hardly seemed real but
he was now a full-fledged agent in the greatest
man hunting division in the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Bob paused a moment at the curb. Another
man who had emerged from the justice building
joined him. It was his uncle, Merritt Hughes, one
of the most famous detectives in the department.
He put his arm around Bob’s shoulders and shook
him in a rough but friendly embrace.</p>
<p>“Well, Bob, how does it feel to be a real federal
agent?” he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>It was a moment before Bob replied, and when
he finally spoke the words came slowly.</p>
<p>“I hardly know,” he confessed, “as yet it
doesn’t seem real, but there is one thing I do
know—I’m going to work night and day to make
a success of this new job.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about making a success,” advised
his uncle. “You’ve got the stuff to make good or
you wouldn’t have been taken into the department.”</p>
<p>“When do you think I’ll get my first assignment
on a new case?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“That’s hard to say,” replied the famous detective,
“but if I were you I’d go home now and
get a good night’s sleep. In this kind of a game
you’d better sleep when you can.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m headed for home now,” said Bob.
“Good night, and thanks for all you’ve done for
me.”</p>
<p>With that the young federal agent strode off
down the avenue, his lungs drinking in great gulps
of the cool air of the fall night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Merritt Hughes stood on the curb of the justice
building watching his nephew until Bob
turned the corner a block away. Anyone noticing
the federal agent would have seen a slight smile
of pleasure on his lips and he might have guessed
that Merritt Hughes was greatly pleased by the
events which had happened in the preceding
hours.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Bob Houston, a plain clerk
in the archives division of the War Department,
temporarily a provisional federal agent, had been
the key figure in preventing the theft of some of
Uncle Sam’s most valuable radio secrets.</p>
<p>Through Bob’s efforts a daring plot had been
thwarted and the men responsible taken into
custody. As a reward for this brilliant work, Bob
had been made a full-fledged agent of the famous
bureau of investigation of the Department of
Justice.</p>
<p>There were many thoughts in Bob’s mind as he
strode toward home that night. Only that afternoon
he had led the raid on the east shore of
Maryland which had resulted in the apprehension
of the gang which had been attempting to steal
the radio secrets. Then, after the return to Washington,
had come eventful hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Bob would never forget the scene in the office
of Waldo Edgar, chief of the bureau of investigation,
when Mr. Edgar had informed Bob that he
was a regular federal agent and had presented his
credentials to him.</p>
<p>Just to make sure that he wasn’t dreaming, Bob
pulled a small leather wallet from an inside coat
pocket and paused under a street light to look at
its contents. There was no mistake. There in the
wallet was a small gold badge which denoted his
office and the finely engraved card which marked
his identification. Bob replaced the wallet with a
particular glow of satisfaction and continued
toward home.</p>
<p>The night air was raw and Bob increased his
pace as he neared the building where he made his
home. He turned in at the entrance and made his
way up to the third floor where he had a comfortable
room in a rear apartment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Bob unlocked the door and snapped on the
light. It was a typical man’s room with a large
chiffonier and a deep clothes closet in one wall.
There was a reading light near the head of the
bed and beside this a large easy chair with a book
rack. A number of books and magazines were
scattered on this rack, and usually Bob sat down
to read for a time before going to bed; but tonight
he was too tired to read and he undressed rapidly.</p>
<p>Tired though he was, sleep was slow in coming
to him as his mind went over the events of recent
hours. Bob wondered just what Tully Ross was
thinking and doing, for Tully had been his rival in
seeking a solution to the mystery of the radio
secrets.</p>
<p>Tully, also a clerk in the archives division of the
War Department, had an uncle, Condon Adams,
who, like Merritt Hughes, was a federal agent.
Both Tully and his uncle had worked on the radio
case, but by dint of Bob’s good fortune and sharp
detective work Bob and his uncle had solved the
case before Tully and <i>his</i> uncle could find the
solution. In spite of this, Tully had been made an
agent in the bureau of investigation and there was
every indication that the rivalry which had started
when they were clerks in the War Department
would continue in their new work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Bob was just dropping asleep when the telephone
beside his bed rang sharply. He turned on
the light and picked up the instrument, all thought
of sleep now gone from his mind. Could it be his
first assignment?</p>
<p>“Hello? Hello?” said Bob anxiously.</p>
<p>But there was no reply over the wire and Bob
clicked the receiver hook several times, finally
deciding that the call must have been the wrong
number.</p>
<p>When Bob finally did get to sleep he slept with
the heaviness of complete nervous and physical
exhaustion. It was mid-forenoon and the sun was
streaming in his windows when he finally awakened.
There had been no instructions to him on
when to report for his new work and he took a
shower and dressed leisurely.</p>
<p>Bob stepped out of the apartment building and
took a deep breath of the crisp air of the mid-fall
morning. Then he walked down the street to a
small shop where he usually had his breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>After ordering his breakfast he picked up a
morning paper on his table and his eyes instantly
focused on the headlines in the center of the front
page:</p>
<p class="center">“FEDERAL AGENTS CAPTURE GANG OF RADIO THIEVES”</p>
<p>Bob read the story with avid attention. Here in
detail was related on the front page of one of the
nation’s great newspapers the complete story of
the part he had played in rounding up the gang of
radio thieves. Bob looked up from the paper. His
face felt flushed and he knew he appeared highly
self-conscious, but no one seemed to be noticing
him and he resumed his reading of the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>It was evident that the reporter who had written
the story must have obtained his information
from a federal agent, but Bob knew that there was
a rule in the department that all information of
this type must come from the head of the department.
He was quite sure that Waldo Edgar had
not given out the story. As Bob read further the
conviction grew that Tully Ross must have supplied
the facts for the newspaper story, for a great
deal of credit had been given to Tully for things
which he had not done.</p>
<p>Bob dropped the paper in disgust. That was just
like Tully to attempt to claim credit for something
which someone else had done.</p>
<p>Bob finished his breakfast, paid his bill and
started walking toward the Department of Justice
Building. He had gone a little more than a block
when a car pulled along the curb and the driver
stuck his head out the window.</p>
<p>“Want a lift, Bob?” asked a pleasant voice and
Bob turned to face Lieutenant Gibbons, War
Department intelligence officer, who had helped
him in the solution of the radio mystery.</p>
<p>Bob climbed into the coupé and Lieutenant
Gibbons sent the car shooting down the avenue,
dodging in and out of the heavy mid-forenoon
stream of traffic.</p>
<p>“Quite a story in the morning papers,” smiled
the lieutenant.</p>
<p>Bob nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>“Looks like Tully Ross has been doing a little
personal press agenting,” he said. “Personally, I’m
not very strong for that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>“Neither am I,” said the lieutenant, “but some
people seem to live on a diet of publicity and I
guess Tully is one of that kind.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant wheeled his coupé up in front
of the Department of Justice Building and Bob
stepped out.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot for the lift,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s all right, Bob. I wonder when we’ll
be working on a case again?”</p>
<p>“That’s hard to say,” grinned Bob. “Hope it
will be soon.”</p>
<p>With that he turned and entered the building
while Lieutenant Gibbons resumed his journey.</p>
<p>Bob took an elevator to the top floor where the
head of the bureau of investigation had his offices.
A clerk in the anteroom took his name and
looked up sharply as he consulted an appointment
chart on his desk.</p>
<p>“I think Mr. Edgar is expecting you,” he said,
“for your name is on his call list this morning.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Bob looked eagerly at the clerk.</p>
<p>“Does this mean I’m going to be assigned to a
case?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t say,” replied the clerk, “but I shouldn’t
be surprised. I’ll send in your name at once. Just
have a seat and wait for a few minutes.”</p>
<p>Bob was the only one in the anteroom and he
sat down on a padded bench beside the clerk’s
desk, with a growing feeling that within a few
minutes he would be called in and assigned on his
first case as a full time federal agent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter II</span></span>
<br>A NEW CASE<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob had been waiting in the anteroom less than
five minutes when the door banged open
and Tully Ross almost catapulted into the
room. Tully was about the last person in the world
that Bob wanted to see just then but he grinned
and made the best of it.</p>
<p>“Hello, Tully. What’s all the hurry?” he asked.</p>
<p>Tully stopped abruptly and stared at Bob.
There was no friendliness in the glance that swept
Bob from head to foot.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to see you here,” he blurted
out.</p>
<p>“That goes for me, too,” replied Bob. “That
was quite a story you gave the reporters last
night.”</p>
<p>A deep flush swept over Tully’s face but he
was quick to deny the implications in Bob’s words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>“What story do you mean?” he asked sharply.</p>
<p>“I guess you know what I mean,” said Bob
evenly. “I thought it was a rule of this department
not to give out news stories.”</p>
<p>“You’re on the wrong track,” Tully insisted;
but Bob knew by the expression on Tully’s face
that Tully had given out the news story, thereby
violating one of the rules of the department.</p>
<p>Tully sat down on a bench on the other side of
the room facing Bob. He was silent for less than
a minute for he could not check his curiosity.</p>
<p>“Have you been assigned to a case yet?” he
asked. There was an envious note in his voice.</p>
<p>“Not yet, but I expect to get an assignment
soon,” said Bob. “Have you a new assignment?”</p>
<p>“I’m expecting one this morning,” replied
Tully confidently. “In fact, that’s why I’m
here.”</p>
<p>The clerk in charge of the room returned and
asked Tully’s name and business.</p>
<p>“Mr. Edgar will be ready to see both of you in
a minute or two,” the clerk advised them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>A buzzer on the clerk’s desk whirred and the
official stepped to the door, opened it and motioned
for Bob and Tully to enter the private
office.</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar, the slender, wiry head of the
bureau of investigation looked up from behind the
pile of papers on his desk. Bob saw a copy of one
of the morning papers spread out in front of the
federal chief and he knew that both he and Tully
were quite likely to be in for some unpleasant moments.</p>
<p>“Good morning, boys,” said Mr. Edgar, but
there was little warmth in his voice and he left
them standing in front of his desk as he pointed to
the story in the paper in front of him. His gaze
centered on Bob.</p>
<p>“Are you responsible for this story, Bob?” he
asked.</p>
<p>The young federal agent’s denial was quick and
confident.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know a thing about the story until I
read it at breakfast this morning,” he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>“This seems to be a pretty accurate account of
what actually took place in the roundup of the
gang responsible for the theft of the radio secrets,”
said the federal chief. “The information
could have been supplied only by someone in our
own department and you know there is a rule
against giving out such information.”</p>
<p>“I know there is such a rule,” said Bob, “and I
can assure you that I have talked to no one.”</p>
<p>Bob’s straightforward words seemed to satisfy
the federal chief and he shifted his gaze to Tully,
who was standing uneasily on first one foot and
then the other.</p>
<p>“What have you to say for yourself, Tully?”</p>
<p>The question was short and pointed and Bob
saw Tully’s eyes shift away from those of Waldo
Edgar.</p>
<p>“I guess I’m to blame for the story,” confessed
Tully. “You see it was this way—”</p>
<p>But Tully’s explanation was cut short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>“I’m not interested in how you happened to
talk,” said the federal chief. “However, I am glad
that you have admitted your indiscretion so
readily. In the future be sure to keep this rule in
mind. It is your job to solve the cases assigned
to you and to keep out of the headlines and off the
front pages of the newspapers. The less publicity
we have the more effective can be our work.”</p>
<p>After delivering that short but pointed lecture
Waldo Edgar picked up a file of papers on his
desk and skimmed through them hurriedly.</p>
<p>“I called both of you in at this time,” he explained,
“because I am assigning you on the same
case.”</p>
<p>Bob glanced sharply at Tully and there was a
deep scowl on his rival’s face. The exchange of
glances was not lost to Waldo Edgar for he was
aware of the rivalry between his youngest agents.</p>
<p>“I realize quite well that both of you are intensely
interested in winning advancement in this
department,” he went on. “For that very reason I
know that when I assign you to a case you will
leave nothing undone until you find the solution.
You may step on one another’s toes in reaching
your goal but you get results and that is what I
want.”</p>
<p>The federal chief once more consulted the file
on his desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>“The mission I am going to send you on is one
which has baffled some of the best men in the
customs service. In other words, I am counting
on you two youngsters, with your enthusiasm and
determination, to get to the bottom of one of the
most difficult cases that has been assigned to this
department in recent years.”</p>
<p>Bob, looking down at the desk in front of him,
saw a number of letters which bore the insignia
of the customs service. Several of them were post-marked
from cities in Florida. In addition, there
were several letters from Paris and London.</p>
<p>“When I tell you that I am assigning you to this
case, don’t think I’m altogether foolish, for both
Merritt Hughes and Condon Adams will be
working with you,” said the federal chief.</p>
<p>Bob knew what that meant. There would be
the same rivalry which had marked the radio
mystery with Condon Adams and Tully Ross attempting
to solve the case before Bob and his
uncle could find the solution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>“I have already had Adams and Hughes in here
this morning and have explained in detail this
case. They have departed on their own assignments
and I shall expect both of you to be on your
way to Florida early in the afternoon.</p>
<p>“Briefly it will be your task to help bring to
justice one of the most daring band of jewel
smugglers that has ever operated between Europe
and the United States. They are so clever and daring
that they have defied the efforts of the best
detectives in the customs service and we have
been appealed to for aid in solving the case.
Actually, we have very little to go upon.</p>
<p>“Apparently this is a small but very versatile
band of men. Just how they get the jewels into
this country is one of the mysteries which you
must solve. One of the few things that we do
know is that they apparently are operating off
the Florida coast, reaching this country by the
means of small, fast boats. It is going to be your
task to attempt to find the base along the Florida
coast where they center their operations.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Waldo Edgar swung around in his chair and
turned to a large map of the United States which
covered the entire wall behind his desk. He
picked up a pointer and touched several spots on
the Florida section on the map.</p>
<p>“Bob,” he instructed, “you are to proceed as
rapidly as possible to Atalissa, a small town on the
coast. That is to be your headquarters for we
know that somewhere in the territory adjacent to
Atalissa these smugglers have been operating. I
must warn you now that you must use every precaution
to keep your identity secret for this particular
section of the Florida coast is not friendly
toward federal men.”</p>
<p>The pointer in the hand of the federal chief
moved further along the map until it paused once
more at a coastal town.</p>
<p>“You are to go to Nira,” he instructed Tully.
“I consider that this is as far south as the smugglers
are operating while Atalissa is the northern point.
Somewhere between these two bases I am sure
you will be able to uncover information which
will be of real value to us.”</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar turned back from the map and
faced his young agents. There was just a trace of
a smile on his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>“Think you can handle this assignment?” he
asked.</p>
<p>Bob was the first to reply.</p>
<p>“I’ll handle it if I have to swim along the whole
coast of Florida,” he said.</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar chuckled. “I don’t think that
will be necessary.”</p>
<p>“How about my uncle and Merritt Hughes?”
asked Tully. “Will they be working in the same
territory?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are working on the Florida angle of
the case and I expect you to keep them advised of
any developments which you are able to uncover.
You can reach them in Jacksonville and their telephone
number will be given to you before you
leave Washington this afternoon. If you call here
at one o’clock, your complete transportation and
expense money will be ready for you as well as a
written file of all the information which we now
have about the jewel smugglers. Can you be ready
by one o’clock?”</p>
<p>“I can go now,” said Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>“Better go home and throw an extra shirt or
two and some socks into a traveling bag,” advised
the federal chief. “I like to see plenty of enthusiasm,
but you may be gone a good many weeks
and you should be thoroughly prepared for a
strenuous trip. If you have boots and some good
heavy clothes, be sure to put them in your bag and
by all means do not go unarmed.”</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar stood up and shook hands with
each of them.</p>
<p>“I will not see you again before you go, but I
expect great things from both of you. I shall
watch your reports with interest.”</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter III</span></span>
<br>“GOOD LUCK”<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob and Tully left the office of the federal
chief together and descended in the same
elevator to the first floor. Both of them
were stirred by a strong feeling of elation for this
was their first assignment since becoming federal
agents.</p>
<p>Bob would have liked to talk the case over
with his uncle, but he knew now that Merritt
Hughes was already on his way to Florida and
whatever Bob was to do on the case he would
have to do alone.</p>
<p>“Seems to me you get all the best of these assignments,”
grumbled Tully. “I know something
about Florida and Nira is just about the last place
in the world I want to go to.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>“I don’t see why you should complain,” said
Bob, “even though Nira may not be a very pleasant
place, for you have a distinct advantage over
me since I have never been to Florida.”</p>
<p>They parted as they walked out of the building,
and Bob, hailing a taxicab, sped toward the
apartment building where he made his home.</p>
<p>Packing was a comparatively simple thing for
Bob. He pulled a serviceable but battered Gladstone
bag out of the closet and opened it upon
the bed.</p>
<p>Fortunately he had a large supply of freshly
laundered clothes and he packed one side of the
bag solid with shirts, socks and underwear. That
done he went back to the closet and rummaged
around until he found an old hunting outfit of
corduroy trousers and coat.</p>
<p>From one corner of the closet he pulled a pair
of heavy boots which were soft and pliable. The
woolen socks which he pulled from the boots had
been almost consumed by moths and Bob threw
the socks away, making a mental note that he
would have to buy more either in Washington or
when he arrived in Florida.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>On the third trip to the closet Bob returned
with a well-worn gun case in his hands. He
opened the brown leather case and drew forth a
special hunting rifle which had been given to
him by his uncle several years before.</p>
<p>The gun had received excellent care as the
gleaming barrel indicated, and Bob, sitting down
on the edge of the bed, caressed it with hands
that were almost affectionate. He had nicknamed
the gun “Ezekiel” after an eccentric old hunter
he had known in his home town in Iowa.</p>
<p>Bob, although not a remarkable shot with a
rifle, could be classed as better than average, for
his eyesight was good and his finger was steady
in its pull on the trigger.</p>
<p>The young federal agent examined the gun
carefully. There was more than a good chance
that it might be called into use if his Florida trip
developed all of the possibilities Waldo Edgar
had indicated. Bob sighted through the barrel of
the gun and smiled to himself as he noted the
cleanness of the bore, for he prided himself on the
care which he had given the weapon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>There was a small box of ammunition in the
gun case and Bob examined the shells. They had
been in the case for three months but there was
no reason to believe that they had deteriorated for
the gun case had been kept in a warm, dry place.</p>
<p>Bob slipped the rifle back into the case, which
was just long enough to fit into his Gladstone bag.
He folded up his corduroy outfit and placed this
on top of the rifle. Then the boots went in and on
top of them he jammed several soft flannel shirts
that could be worn a reasonable time without
laundering. It was impossible to foretell just what
he would encounter in Florida and he wanted to
be prepared for every possible emergency.</p>
<p>The packing had taken longer than Bob had
expected and when he looked at his watch he
realized that there was little time to lose if he expected
to reach the justice department building
for his one o’clock appointment. Bob jammed his
shaving outfit in on top of his clothes and closed
the bag. It fairly bulged with the articles he had
packed away and the big case was both clumsy
and heavy to carry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Bob looked around his room as he paused at the
door. It might be weeks before he would return
and he would miss the orderly pleasantness of the
room with his comfortable chair and his excellent
books.</p>
<p>Then he closed and locked the door and walked
down the hallway as rapidly as he could with his
heavy bag. He summoned a taxi and started for
the Department of Justice Building where detailed
instructions were awaiting him.</p>
<p>The ride down town took less than ten minutes
and Bob reached the building at five minutes to
one, just in time to see Tully Ross precede him
through the main entrance.</p>
<p>Bob paid his taxi fare and then left his heavy
bag at the information desk on the main floor
while he was whirled upward in an elevator. The
same clerk who had greeted him that morning was
on duty in the outer office and Tully, seated on a
bench, was opening a large Manila envelope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>“Your instructions, train tickets, expense
money and data on the case are all in this envelope,”
said the clerk, handing a similar container
to Bob. “Your train leaves at 1:30 so I suggest
that you get to the station at once and then
go into the details of this case after you are on
your way south.”</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot,” nodded Bob. “I’m on my way.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” said the clerk, who looked enviously
after Bob, for after all there were not
very many thrills in clerical work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter IV</span></span>
<br>TULLY’S CHALLENGE<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Tully Ross followed Bob into the elevator
and they dropped toward the first floor.</p>
<p>“I guess we’re taking the same train as
far as Jacksonville,” said Tully. “What a pleasure
that’s going to be!”</p>
<p>Tully’s last words were sneering and vindictive,
and a little of Bob’s pent-up resentment burst out.
Fortunately no one else was in the elevator at the
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>“You’d better take inventory of yourself,
Tully,” advised Bob, “or you’re going to run
head-on into trouble. I haven’t got it in for you
and you can take full credit for anything that you
do. Don’t be so blamed suspicious of everything.
You do your work and I’ll do mine. The main
thing is going to be to solve this case and I don’t
care who does it just as long as we are successful.
If you’d only warm up a little we could go over
this case on the way south this afternoon and we
might have some ideas that we could both benefit
by.”</p>
<p>Tully looked suspicious.</p>
<p>“What are you getting at?” he asked.</p>
<p>They were on the main floor again and passengers
bound for the upper floors swept into the
elevator.</p>
<p>“We’ll take a taxi together to the station and
I’ll tell you on the way there,” said Bob.</p>
<p>Tully had two smaller bags while Bob had only
the large gladstone and they loaded the bags and
themselves into a taxi and started for the union station.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to get at this,” said Bob. “Both
of us have chances for brilliant futures in this service
if we don’t let personal rivalry warp our better
judgment. That was a shabby trick of yours in
giving that story to the newspapers and I rather
think you hoped that I would be blamed.”</p>
<p>Tully was silent and Bob went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>“I’m willing to let that pass and some other
things that have happened if you feel that you’re
willing to work along with me on this case. The
old saying that two heads are better than one is
certainly true in this kind of work and we can
both benefit by it. What do you say?”</p>
<p>Bob’s clear, blue eyes bored deep into Tully’s
brown ones and he held out his hand.</p>
<p>Tully held Bob’s gaze for a moment and then
his eyes shifted uneasily. He made no motion to
take Bob’s proffered hand.</p>
<p>“Well, if that’s the way you feel about it, I’m
glad that we have had a definite understanding,”
said Bob.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s the way it’s got to be,” said Tully
slowly. “I don’t like you, Bob, and there’s no use
in making any bones about it. I’m going to solve
this case even if I have to step all over you in doing
it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>“Well, Tully, you just run along and do your
best; but I’m serving fair warning on you right
now that if you try to step on any of my toes,
you’ll wish you hadn’t. There’s only one way to
play this game and that’s to play it fair and square.
I’m going to play it that way and I’m going to win
and nothing that you can do will stop me. If it is
humanly possible that case will be solved within
the next few weeks.”</p>
<p>Tully looked squarely at Bob.</p>
<p>“Is that a challenge?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Call it anything you like.”</p>
<p>“Then I say that you won’t solve it in two
months if you solve it at all.”</p>
<p>“Two months it is,” retorted Bob, “and by that
I mean that every angle of this case will be cleaned
up and either all of the men connected with it in
federal custody or beyond our reach and you can
put that down in writing if you want to.”</p>
<p>“I won’t do that,” sneered Tully, “for it might
be too embarrassing to have to have it recalled
when you fail.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to fail,” said Bob firmly, and although
Tully wouldn’t have admitted it at the
time, he had a premonition that Bob was right—that
he would not fail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter V</span></span>
<br>ON THE SOUTHERN LIMITED<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>The taxi pulled up in front of the union
station and Bob and Tully, spurning the
offers of red caps, carried their luggage
into the huge structure.</p>
<p>The great terminal was alive with activity and
through the loud speaker system the departures of
half a dozen famous trains were being announced.</p>
<p>Bob’s Gladstone was too heavy to carry very
far without shifting it from hand to hand. When
he reached the train shed he put the bag down beside
him and opened the envelope in which his
tickets had been placed. His Pullman reservation
called for lower five in car 43 on train number 7,
the Southern Limited. Tully paused beside Bob.</p>
<p>“Are you in car 43?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Lower five,” said Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>“Humph,” grunted Tully. “What luck I have.
There must have been some mistake. I’m in upper
five.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think there was any mistake,”
grinned Bob as he visualized how Tully, who was
inclined to stoutness, would look scrambling in
and out of upper five that night. “Perhaps the
clerk who made out these tickets thought you
needed a little exercise.”</p>
<p>Picking up their bags they walked to the nearest
train gate where the ticket inspector checked
their tickets and waved them toward the Southern
Limited, which was standing on track number
three.</p>
<p>Car 43, in which they were to make their
journey southward, was near the center of the
train and by the time Bob and Tully were comfortably
seated in the car, the porters were making
their final calls of “’bo-o-oard.” The Southern
Limited started slowly but easily picked up speed
as the trucks clicked over the joints.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Travel that day was light and there was only
one other passenger on the car, a man who appeared
to be about forty, short, dark, but marked
with a distinguishing streak of grey in the center
of his head. He was the type of man who, though
he attracted attention, did not invite acquaintanceship.</p>
<p>Tully continued to grumble at intervals, complaining
that it was grossly unfair for Bob to have
a lower berth while he was compelled to climb
into an upper.</p>
<p>But Bob ignored Tully’s complaints. The train
was soon speeding into Virginia and with the
capital behind Bob took out the envelope with the
history of the case they were working on. Since
they were practically alone on the car it would
be an ideal time to go over this material and memorize
in detail all of the essential information contained
in it.</p>
<p>Tully likewise pulled out the heavy manila
envelope which contained a copy of the same report
Bob had in his hands but instead of reading
it there Tully went forward into the smoking
compartment. Bob knew that Tully did not
smoke so it was obvious that Tully had gone forward
simply to get away from him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>There were a dozen closely typed sheets in the
report and they reviewed in detail all of the activities
of the jewel smugglers which were known
to the federal officials. As he read, Bob was astounded
at the daring with which the smuggling
was conducted.</p>
<p>The reports indicated clearly that the headquarters
for the smuggling operations must lie
somewhere along the east coast of Florida and the
names of both Nira and Atalissa appeared frequently
in the typed reports. It was evident that
at least half a dozen federal men, most of them
in the customs service, had been working on
the case at various times.</p>
<p>There was one paragraph in their report that
struck Bob with unusual force. It read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>“A conservative estimate of the amount of
jewels which the gang has smuggled into this
country in the last six months would be at least
half a million dollars. There is no way of knowing
just how extensive are their operations.
Agents are especially warned to use great care in
any approach to any members of this gang.
Agents working on this case should go armed at
all times. It is imperative that the men responsible
for these operations be taken into custody
at the earliest possible time.”</p>
<p>Bob read this paragraph several times and it
brought home to him the possible dangers which
he might face in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The other passenger in the car whose seat was
behind Bob got up and went forward into the
smoking compartment where Tully had gone
previously.</p>
<p>Bob looked up as the man went past him. The
stranger was powerfully built and Bob especially
noticed the breadth and strength of his hands.</p>
<p>Bob thought little of the incident but hoped
that Tully would have the good sense to put
away the secret papers when the stranger entered
the smoking compartment. As the train sped
through the fertile Virginia farm lands the young
federal agent continued his perusal of the report.</p>
<p>The concluding paragraph was such that he
read it three or four times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>“From all information at hand, it appears obvious
that not more than five men are involved
in this smuggling enterprise. So far we have been
unable to identify positively any member of the
gang so all agents are doubly warned against any
incautious remarks which might indicate the
reason for their visit to Florida. In case of any
unusual emergency notify headquarters by long
distance telephone at once.”</p>
<p>Bob went back over the report again in detail
and, when he had finished, placed it in the
sturdy envelope, sealed it, and put it in his Gladstone
bag. He felt now that he knew as much
about the case as it was possible to learn until he
actually reached Atalissa.</p>
<p>After a time Bob walked forward and stepped
into the smoking compartment where Tully and
the stranger were engaged in animated conversation.</p>
<p>Tully looked up but there was little warmth in
his glance. That, however, did not deter Bob
from sitting down on one of the comfortable
leather upholstered benches. The stranger looked
at Bob and a rather pleasant smile framed his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>“Going to Florida?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Jacksonville,” said Bob laconically.</p>
<p>“That’s fine, I’m going there too. Hamsa, Joe
Hamsa, is the name,” said the stranger reaching
over and extending his hand in greeting.</p>
<p>Bob grasped the extended hand but he winced
slightly at the strength of the other’s grip.</p>
<p>“I’m Bob Houston of Washington,” replied
Bob by way of introducing himself.</p>
<p>“Going south on business or just taking a vacation?”
asked Joe Hamsa and Bob thought there
was a peculiar flicker in the other’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a combination of both,” replied
Bob.</p>
<p>“Wish I could say as much,” went on Hamsa,
“but it’s all business with me. I’m glad you boys
are on the car today. I don’t like to travel alone
and especially at night.”</p>
<p>Bob wondered just why Mr. Hamsa, who appeared
perfectly capable of taking care of himself,
did not care to travel alone. He was not in
doubt long for Hamsa suddenly developed a voluble
streak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>“Diamonds are my specialty,” he said, “and
I’ve been held up once or twice. Believe me,
there’s no fun in that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hamsa did not look particularly like the
type of man who would submit to a holdup
peacefully, and there was something about him
that aroused suspicions in Bob’s mind.</p>
<p>The young federal agent glanced across the
compartment to where Tully was seated and he
was surprised to note that the papers in the confidential
report on the smuggling ring were
scattered on the seat beside Tully.</p>
<p>What was even more astounding was the pallor
of Tully’s face, and the glassy stare in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Tully,” cried Bob, “what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>But there was no response from Tully except a
slight twitching of his lips which indicated that
he might be trying to answer.</p>
<p>“Tully,” repeated Bob, “what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>The sharp questions voiced by the young
federal agent caused Hamsa also to turn and stare
at Tully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Bob was less than six feet away from Tully,
yet the other failed to answer his questions or to
give any sign of recognition. He sat there like a
man under a hypnotic spell.</p>
<p>Bob leaped to his feet and in one long stride
was beside Tully. With firm hands he grasped
Tully’s shoulders and shook him vigorously.</p>
<p>Tully’s head dropped forward on his chest and
he seemed suddenly to collapse, sliding forward
off the leather bench and falling to the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter VI</span></span>
<br>STRANGE EVENTS<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Tully’s collapse came so suddenly that
Bob was unable to check his fall to the
floor, but he leaned down almost instantly
and lifted Tully back on one of the benches.</p>
<p>Bob’s face was close to Tully’s and he caught
a whiff of an acrid smell on Tully’s breath. His
companion’s breathing was slow and distinctly
labored.</p>
<p>Bob grasped one of Tully’s wrists and checked
the pulse beat. His knowledge of first aid was
somewhat limited, but the steadiness of the pulse
count reassured him and he decided that Tully
had probably fallen victim to a sudden fainting
attack.</p>
<p>Joe Hamsa leaned over Bob and attempted to
aid him in ministering to Tully.</p>
<p>“Anything I can do?” he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>“Get a cup of water,” said Bob, and Hamsa
hastened away to do his bidding. He was back
soon with the paper cup brimming full of water.
Bob moistened his handkerchief in this and bathed
Tully’s cheeks and forehead while Hamsa loosened
his tie and collar, and massaged his wrists.</p>
<p>Just then the Pullman conductor came into the
compartment.</p>
<p>“What’s doing here?” he asked.</p>
<p>Bob answered without looking up.</p>
<p>“I think my companion suffered a fainting attack.
Have you any smelling salts?”</p>
<p>“I have some in my first aid kit up ahead,” replied
the conductor, departing to obtain it.</p>
<p>He returned in less than a minute with the
smelling salts and Bob gave Tully several deep
sniffs from the pungent smelling bottle. The
penetrating qualities of the salts seemed to reach
Tully’s subconscious mind and draw away the
curtain which had clouded his consciousness. He
made an effort to rouse himself but Bob speaking
in a low voice forced him back on the leather
bench.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>“Take it easy, Tully,” he advised. “You’ll
feel stronger in a short time.”</p>
<p>Tully opened his eyes and stared at them. It
was evident that he had no idea what had happened
to him.</p>
<p>Bob, who had been somewhat concerned when
he saw the sheets of Tully’s confidential report
laying out in the open, now took time to look for
them. They were still scattered on one of the
leather benches and as far as Bob could determine
they had not been disturbed. He reached out and
with the sweep of one hand brushed them into a
pile at one corner of the bench. Fortunately they
had been turned face down, and Bob felt sure
that there had been no opportunity for either
Hamsa or the Pullman conductor to read the
contents.</p>
<p>Tully attempted to sit up and Bob’s attention
returned to his unfortunate traveling companion.
Tully still appeared shaken but his eyes were
clearer and once more there was a touch of color
in his cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Tully signalled that he would like a drink of
water and Hamsa hurried away to fill another
paper cup from the tank in the vestibule. When
he returned Tully took several deep draughts of
the water and he appeared greatly refreshed.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what happened,” he mumbled,
shaking his head slowly. “My mind seems so
heavy. I can’t think.”</p>
<p>“Better take it easy for a while,” advised Bob.
“Here, stretch out on this couch. I’ll get the
porter to bring you a blanket.”</p>
<p>Bob stepped out and called the porter who was
in the other end of the car, and, thus far, unaware
that anything unusual had taken place in the
smoking compartment. At Bob’s instructions he
brought a blanket and placed it over Tully. Then
he brought in a pillow and the federal agent was
made as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>“Want me to make up a berth?” asked the
porter, but Tully shook his head.</p>
<p>“Not now. I’ll be all right here. Just let me
rest.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Bob’s keen eyes roved around the smoking
compartment. The papers which had been in
Tully’s confidential envelope had been placed
on the opposite couch, evidently by Hamsa or
the Pullman conductor. Bob caught a quick
glance from Tully and sensed that the other
wanted the papers put away at once.</p>
<p>The young federal agent stepped over to the
leather couch, scooped up the sheets of typewritten
paper, and placed them in the envelope.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Tully, when Bob handed the
package to him. He slipped the documents into
an inner pocket of his coat, closed his eyes, and
was soon in a deep sleep.</p>
<p>This might have been alarming had not Tully’s
breathing been deep and natural and the color in
his cheeks more normal.</p>
<p>“I think he’s coming around all right,” said
Hamsa, who had remained in the smoking compartment.
“Looks to me like it might have been
an attack of acute indigestion.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” agreed Bob, but for his own satisfaction
he would have preferred to have a doctor
examine Tully. He stepped outside into the corridor
to speak to the Pullman conductor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>“Do you know if there is a doctor on the
train?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe so. We’re running light today
but I’ll find out; your friend any worse?”</p>
<p>“No. He’s better, but I’d like to find out just
what happened to him.”</p>
<p>“I can wire ahead and have an ambulance meet
us at the next division point,” suggested the conductor.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that will be necessary,” replied
Bob. “We’re anxious to get to Jacksonville
on this train. However, I wish you would ascertain
if there is a doctor aboard.”</p>
<p>As the trainman hurried away, Bob stepped
back into the smoking compartment. There was
something definitely puzzling and disturbing
about the sudden illness which had overtaken
Tully, for the latter was usually in the best of
health.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Bob thought back over the days of their association
in the archives division of the War Department,
trying to remember if Tully had ever
been the subject of sudden fainting spells. As
far as he could recall, nothing like this had occurred
before, which did not make his mind rest
any easier.</p>
<p>Hamsa wandered out of the smoking compartment
and Bob and Tully were alone. Half an
hour slipped by and Tully remained in the deep
sleep.</p>
<p>The train had stopped once, a long halt for
coal and water, and it was after it resumed motion
that the Pullman conductor returned to the compartment.</p>
<p>“I’ve been all over the train, even into the day
coaches ahead, and there isn’t even a veterinarian
aboard. Sure you don’t want us to wire for an
ambulance to meet you? We’ll be in at the next
division point in an hour and a half.”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you know definitely a little later. If
he doesn’t rouse from this sleep, it may be necessary
to do just that.”</p>
<p>“Anything more I can do?” asked the conductor,
but Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’ll stay here and watch him. If I need any
help, I’ll signal for the porter.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The curtains at the doorway swished down
behind the departing figure of the conductor,
leaving Bob and Tully alone once more.</p>
<p>The afternoon was waning as the train sped
southward, the steady clicking of the trucks
underneath indicating that the Limited was doing
at least a mile a minute. The roadbed was smooth
and the high speed did not make the car ride uncomfortably.</p>
<p>While Tully was asleep, Bob studied his companion’s
face. Tully’s features were really remarkably
strong and if he made an effort to look
pleasant he would have been a handsome young
man. But his lips were inclined to a perpetual
downward curve that made it appear that a steady
scowl was on his face.</p>
<p>Bob would have enjoyed liking Tully, for
there were many qualities in the other that were
outstanding. For instance, Tully was sturdy and
he had the power to drive steadily toward a goal
once he set his ambition to that end. It was too
bad that he let personal feelings creep into his
work and sway his better judgment, such as challenging
Bob to beat him to a solution of the jewel
smuggling case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Bob was a better than average judge of character
and he knew that Tully would worry so
much about what he was doing that Tully’s own
keen mind would be somewhat dulled on the
case. For that reason Bob had not hesitated to
take up the challenge.</p>
<p>The Limited plunged into a short but heavy
rain storm and drops of water streamed down the
windows. It was not an especially auspicious beginning
to their manhunt.</p>
<p>Tully moved restlessly and Bob thought for
a time that his companion was about to wake up,
but Tully’s breathing deepened once more and
his eyes remained closed.</p>
<p>Joe Hamsa stuck his head into the compartment.</p>
<p>“Any change?” he asked, and Bob thought he
appeared a little too solicitous for a passing acquaintance.</p>
<p>“I think he’s resting easier,” replied Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>“Are you going to take him to a hospital?”
asked Hamsa, pressing Bob for further information
on his plans.</p>
<p>“I haven’t decided yet.”</p>
<p>“Let me know if there is anything I can do,”
volunteered the other. It was apparent that he
would have liked an invitation to stay in the room,
but Bob turned toward the rain-washed windows
and after a brief pause Hamsa dropped the curtain
at the doorway and walked back into the
Pullman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter VII</span></span>
<br>THE MAN ON THE PLATFORM<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Tully remained in the deep sleep for another
fifteen minutes. Then he stirred
restlessly and Bob went over to his side.
As he looked down Tully opened his eyes. They
appeared clear and perfectly normal.</p>
<p>Tully attempted to sit up, but Bob put his
hands on his shoulders and gently pushed him
back on the couch.</p>
<p>“Take it easy for a while, Tully,” he said.</p>
<p>“What happened?” the other demanded, and
Bob noted that the words were slow and his
speech thick.</p>
<p>Then before he could answer, Tully grunted
and made a face.</p>
<p>“Get me some water, quick.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Bob hastened out into the corridor where he
filled a paper cup to the brim. Tully drank every
drop and signaled for another cup, which Bob
procured immediately.</p>
<p>When that was done, Tully appeared greatly
refreshed.</p>
<p>“Help me prop this pillow up so I can sit up
a little,” he urged Bob, and he was soon in a more
comfortable position.</p>
<p>The rain still washed the windows of the car,
and the porter, entering the compartment, turned
on the top lights, for it was nearly dark.</p>
<p>Before he spoke again Tully felt inside his
coat and, reassured that the documents on the
jewel smuggling case were there, he looked at
Bob.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember very much,” he said slowly,
“but all of a sudden everything went dark. I
felt that I was going to fall but I couldn’t move.
I couldn’t even reach out my hands and neither
could I say a word.”</p>
<p>He paused and Bob felt that it would be well
for him to explain what he had seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>“You looked like you were hypnotized,” he
explained. “I came over and caught you, but you
were out cold. Believe me, you had us worried
for a while.”</p>
<p>Just then the Pullman conductor looked in.</p>
<p>“Made up your mind about calling an ambulance
at the division point?” he asked. Then he
saw Tully propped into a half-way sitting position
and his face brightened.</p>
<p>“Coming around now?”</p>
<p>“He’s feeling better. We’ll go right on
through to Jacksonville,” said Bob and the conductor
went on about his duties.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you think I’d come around?” asked
Tully, a look of worry on his forehead.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know just what was happening
for a while,” explained Bob. “You had us pretty
badly scared.”</p>
<p>Tully looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>“I honestly don’t know what took place,” he
said, slowly shaking his head. “It seemed as
though blackness simply exploded in my face.
Actually I believe there was some kind of a
shock or blow on my face.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>“I don’t know what it could have been,” replied
Bob. “Hamsa and I were the only ones
with you and you had been visiting with Hamsa
for some time before I came in.”</p>
<p>“He’s a queer duck,” muttered Tully. “I don’t
know whether I could like or trust him.”</p>
<p>Bob had exactly the same feeling and he was
interested to know Tully’s reaction to their
traveling companion.</p>
<p>“I’m still kind of sleepy. Guess I’ll take another
nap. You might tell the porter to make up
my berth.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have him fix up lower five for you,” replied
Bob. “I’ll take the upper for you probably
won’t feel much like climbing in and out of a
berth for the next few hours. Think you’ll want
anything to eat tonight?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps a little soup later,” nodded Tully as
he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Bob remained in the compartment for several
minutes until he was sure that Tully was in a
deep and comfortable sleep. Then he returned to
the main section of the Pullman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>As he turned in the corridor and could look
down the full length of the car he thought he
caught just a glimpse of Hamsa dodging out the
other end of the car.</p>
<p>Only a few lights were on and Bob could not
be sure that his eyes were not playing tricks on
him. In any event he hastened his pace and when
he reached the section which he and Tully occupied
he drew his big Gladstone bag out from
under one of the seats.</p>
<p>Bob breathed easier when he saw the envelope
which contained the confidential information on
the smuggling was just where he had left it. It
had been more than a little careless of him to leave
such valuable data unprotected for so long a time.</p>
<p>It was fully dark and Bob snapped on the individual
lights in the berth and rang the buzzer
for the porter, who appeared almost immediately.</p>
<p>Bob instructed him to make up both the lower
and upper berth.</p>
<p>“I’m going ahead into the diner. Let me know
when you’ve finished,” he said, “and also keep
an eye on my friend in the smoking compartment.
If he should wake up, inform me at once.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>The rush to reach the train plus the exciting
events of the afternoon had made Bob ravenously
hungry and when he entered the dining car he
splurged by ordering a large porterhouse steak
and an extra order of French fried potatoes.</p>
<p>The conductor had been right when he described
travel on the Southern that night as light
for there were only five others in the diner in
addition to Bob. All of them were strangers,
three of them being women and the other two
rather elderly men who were engaged in an animated
conversation on the economic problems of
the day.</p>
<p>Bob summoned the steward, explained that a
companion was ill, and asked that a nourishing
soup be prepared for him to take back to the Pullman
when he returned.</p>
<p>The steak, when it was brought in, was both
thick and tender, and the potatoes were done
just to the right crispness. It was a meal that Bob
could thoroughly enjoy and he ate it in comparative
leisure, relying on the Pullman porter to
call him if Tully awakened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The train slowed to a smooth halt in a North
Carolina mill town and Bob looked out on the
well lighted station platform. The rain was
descending in torrents now and Bob knew
that it might be hard to keep the Limited on
the fast schedule which its time card demanded.</p>
<p>It was evidently a service stop for the train
remained at the station for at least ten minutes.
Bob, watching from the windows, could see anyone
on the platform and he was startled to catch
a glimpse of a man hurrying along beside the
train. He had just a glimpse, but the man, short
and rather bulky, was making what appeared to
Bob to be an obvious effort to avoid attracting
attention for he was hugging the side of the train.
He was clad in a dark oilskin and a soft hat, pulled
well down, shielded his face.</p>
<p>Bob pressed his own face against the glass and
peered along the platform. Up ahead a brightly
illuminated sign marked the telegraph office, and
Bob saw the man hurry inside, but the distance
was too great for him to see the other’s face. In
less than a minute the man reappeared, but he
did not come back along the train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Then the Limited plunged southward again,
beating its way into the teeth of the storm, and
Bob wondered if Joe Hamsa could have been
the man on the platform.</p>
<p>Bob finished his meal and after paying his bill
went back into car 43 to see how Tully was getting
along. He found him awake and ready for
something to eat.</p>
<p>“Soup would taste good,” nodded Tully when
Bob suggested it and the young federal agent returned
to the diner at once. When he re-entered
the car he saw Joe Hamsa seated at the far end
of the diner and he was sure that he had not
passed Hamsa either going or coming from car
43. That meant that Hamsa had been up ahead
some place.</p>
<p>Bob thought the diamond salesman made a deliberate
effort to avoid his eyes by staring intently
through the storm-bathed windows of the car.
The soup was ready and Bob followed a waiter
who carried it back to the Pullman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>The train was traveling at a wild pace now and
Bob almost lost his balance as he walked between
the cars. As the anger of the storm deepened, he
became more convinced than before that Joe
Hamsa was the man he had seen on the station
platform and there was something about the wildness
of the night and Tully’s sudden illness that
caused grave apprehension in Bob’s mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter VIII</span></span>
<br>TULLY’S PAPERS VANISH<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>When Bob returned to the Pullman,
Tully was obviously much refreshed
from his deep sleep and he ate the
soup with real relish. After he was through and
the waiter had gone, Tully spoke to him.</p>
<p>“I’ll appreciate it if you’ll give me a hand
down to the berth,” he said. “My legs are still
a little shaky, but I guess I’m all right otherwise.
A good night’s sleep will put me back to normal.”</p>
<p>Bob supported Tully and together they walked
down to the berth which had been made up. Joe
Hamsa was not in the car.</p>
<p>“I still can’t figure out what happened to me,”
said Tully, shaking his head.</p>
<p>“You are sure I wasn’t struck over the head?”
he looked at Bob so sharply that Bob was inclined
to laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>“Don’t accuse me of doing a thing like that,”
he retorted, but there was no anger in his words.</p>
<p>“But I tell you it felt like something struck my
face. Then there was a blanket of darkness that
settled over me and I couldn’t move or say a
word. It was a mighty helpless sort of feeling.”</p>
<p>Bob agreed that there had been nothing pleasant
about the experience and he helped Tully in
getting undressed. Tully drew the letter with
its confidential report on the smuggling ring out
of an inner pocket.</p>
<p>“This goes under my pillow,” he said.</p>
<p>“I thought it was kind of foolish for you to
read it while Hamsa was in the smoking compartment
with you,” said Bob, and a flicker of
anger glowed in Tully’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Hamsa’s all right,” he replied. “You take
care of your copy and I’ll take care of mine.”</p>
<p>With that Tully pulled out the flap of the
envelope and drew forth the closely typewritten
pages which comprised the report.</p>
<p>Bob saw a sudden, startled change in Tully’s
face, and he leaned closer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>“Bob,” whispered the other. “Look at these
pages. Am I seeing things?”</p>
<p>Bob picked up the handful of data and scanned
the typewritten words. Even before he read the
printing on the page he knew that something was
wrong for the paper was thicker than that upon
which his report had been written.</p>
<p>But the real shock was when he read the first
page. It was a recipe for making dill pickles.</p>
<p>“It’s a pickle recipe,” gasped Bob.</p>
<p>Tully nodded grimly.</p>
<p>“Look at the rest of them!”</p>
<p>Bob skimmed through the pages, bending
down to examine each one closely. Instead of
the confidential data the pages were mimeographed
recipes and Bob and Tully stared at
each other in amazement.</p>
<p>“My report’s been stolen!”</p>
<p>It was Tully speaking and he sounded like a
stricken man. Then he grasped Bob’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a trick you’re playing on me?” he
demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>“Don’t be silly,” said Bob firmly. “That isn’t
my idea of a joke. We’ve got to get busy now.”</p>
<p>Bob pressed the buzzer for the porter, who put
in an almost immediate appearance.</p>
<p>“Get the Pullman conductor here at once,”
he commanded.</p>
<p>“Sorry, boss, but he’s eating supper up ahead.”</p>
<p>“Get him,” retorted Bob, and the manner in
which he gave the order sent the porter scurrying
up the aisle.</p>
<p>“How could this have happened?” asked
Tully, and from the heaviness of his voice Bob
knew that his companion had not fully thrown
off the effects of the attack which had overcome
him that afternoon.</p>
<p>“The secret of this is somewhere on the
Limited,” replied Bob. “Only three people, in
addition to myself, were in the compartment
with you. One was the Pullman conductor, the
other was Hamsa, and the third was the porter.
I think we can rule out the porter for he was in
there only once or twice. There’s just a chance
the conductor might have come back in while I
was in the diner.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>“What motive would he have in taking such
a report?” Tully wanted to know and Bob confessed
that there apparently was none.</p>
<p>The conductor, evidently irritated at being
called from his dinner, entered the car and hurried
down to the section.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked crisply.</p>
<p>Bob did not like the tone of his voice and he
drew forth the little badge which identified him.
The conductor’s eyes widened in astonishment
and there was an instant change in his attitude.
He looked toward Tully significantly.</p>
<p>“Prisoner?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No. He’s a federal agent like myself. Sometime
after he was stricken this afternoon an envelope
containing valuable information was taken
from him and worthless papers substituted.”</p>
<p>“You’re not suspecting me of this, are you?”
asked the conductor and there was such pathetic
anxiety in his voice that Bob felt that the man was
innocent of any wrong doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>“I’m not suspecting or accusing anyone at
present,” replied Bob. “I simply want to know
if you saw anything unusual going on in this
car at any time while I was in the diner and while
my companion was asleep on the couch in the
compartment ahead.”</p>
<p>The conductor shook his head.</p>
<p>“I was through the car twice,” he said, “and
the only one here was the man who had lower
nine. The first time he was in his seat and the
second time he was near the rear vestibule. He
had on a slicker and had the upper part of the
door open.”</p>
<p>“When was that?” The question shot eagerly
from Bob’s lips.</p>
<p>“Just before our last stop at Atkinson where
we took on coal and water,” replied the conductor.
“I didn’t notice him again until up in the
diner a few minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“The vestibule door was opened by someone
while we were in Atkinson,” put in the porter.</p>
<p>“Then lower nine’s passenger must have taken
a walk. Fine night for a thing like that,” said
the conductor. “Come to think of it, I did see
his slicker on another chair in the diner.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>There was no question now but that Joe
Hamsa had been the man Bob had seen on the
station platform, and the suspicious feeling Bob
had held toward him from the beginning was
strengthened.</p>
<p>“I’m going forward to talk with Hamsa,” he
told Tully, and he started ahead through the
train as fast as he could walk.</p>
<p>When he reached the diner the steward was
turning down the lights.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a dark, heavy-set fellow who
was wearing a black slicker,” said Bob. “He belongs
in car 43.”</p>
<p>“He left not more than two or three minutes
ago,” replied the steward. “You should have met
him, for he started back into the Pullmans.”</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>“I just came from car 43 and he couldn’t have
passed me.”</p>
<p>“He might have turned around and gone up
into the coaches,” said the steward. “I’ve been
busy in the kitchen checking with the chef. You
might look up ahead.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Bob went up into the day coaches and found
the train conductor in the forward car. There
were three day coaches on the train and the conductor
was busy making out his reports.</p>
<p>The young federal agent wasted no time in
identifying himself.</p>
<p>“There’s a man aboard I want to question,”
he explained. “He was in the diner a few minutes
ago and after finishing his meal started back for
the Pullmans. He belongs in lower nine of car
43, but I’m sure he didn’t reach there. Get your
brakeman out and search this train.”</p>
<p>The small gold badge Bob displayed worked
magic with the trainman and he summoned his
brakeman. Bob gave them a brief description
of Hamsa and they started back through the
train.</p>
<p>Every vestibule and every compartment was
checked as the three worked methodically. They
even looked into the kitchen on the dining car
while the chef, a jolly negro, grinned at them.</p>
<p>Back in car 43 they found the Pullman conductor
standing watch beside Tully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>“There’s no sign of Hamsa up ahead,” said
Bob. “He didn’t come this way?”</p>
<p>“No one’s been through this car,” replied the
Pullman official firmly.</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>“A man can’t vanish on a train and we’ve been
running too fast for him to jump off. That would
have been sheer suicide.”</p>
<p>There were two more Pullmans and an observation
lounge car behind car 43 and with the
trainmen at his heels, Bob resumed the search.</p>
<p>The next two cars were practically deserted
and even in the observation lounge there were
only five passengers in addition to the porter.
They looked up with evident interest at the
wholesale invasion of the trainmen and the grim
intentness of the expression on Bob’s face.</p>
<p>But the observation car failed to yield any
sign of Hamsa and Bob stepped out on the rain-lashed
platform. The Limited whistled sharply
and seconds later rumbled through a small village.
Then the train was rushing through the desolate
night once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>The young federal agent turned and re-entered
the car and the feeling of unrest which had
gripped him ever since meeting Joe Hamsa
deepened. There was something about the diamond
salesman that sent shivers up and down
Bob’s spine.</p>
<p>“That fellow’s got to be on the train some
place for we haven’t even slowed up since we
left Atkinson,” said the train conductor. “We’d
better look again.”</p>
<p>They started forward, once more examining
every compartment aboard the train, and this
time they even went into the baggage car, but
the baggageman insisted that no one had been
through his car.</p>
<p>Back in the first day coach they stopped to
take council.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid he’s fallen off the train in some
manner,” said the train conductor. “We’re stopping
in ten minutes at a junction and I’ll send a
wire back to division headquarters. They’ll warn
all trains over the road to watch for him.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Bob, however, doubted that Hamsa had fallen
from the train for he felt that the diamond salesman
was far too clever and cautious to be the
victim of such an accident.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter IX</span></span>
<br>BOB GETS A WARNING<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>The young federal agent returned to car
43 and related in detail to Tully the result
of the search of the train.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem possible that Hamsa could be
on the train, yet I am sure that he did not fall off,”
concluded Bob.</p>
<p>“I’ve the same feeling,” said Tully. “You’re
sure you didn’t miss any place?”</p>
<p>“We looked in every closet and compartment
aboard the Limited,” insisted Bob. “We’d have
found even a fly if one had been aboard.”</p>
<p>Tully was visibly downcast for he felt the loss
of his confidential instructions keenly.</p>
<p>“Hamsa is the only one who could have taken
them,” he said, half to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Bob felt like telling Tully that he should have
known better than to have opened and read them
in the presence of anyone else, but he checked
the impulse, and was glad that he had had the
foresight to protect his own papers by placing
them in his Gladstone bag.</p>
<p>The train slowed to a stop at a lonely junction
and Bob went to the vestibule where the porter
opened the upper half of the door for him.</p>
<p>The federal agent, peering ahead through the
rain, saw the train conductor make a dash for
the station where a night operator was on duty.
The conductor ran back to the train just before
the engineer “whistled in” the flagman and Bob
knew that already a message was humming over
the wires telling of the disappearance of Joe
Hamsa, the diamond salesman.</p>
<p>The porter closed the upper half of the door
and Bob returned to the Pullman. The lights had
been turned low and he looked in at Tully, who
was dozing.</p>
<p>Bob was too wide awake to think of sleep just
then, and he went ahead to the smoking compartment,
where the porter had left an evening paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Bob picked up the paper and scanned the headlines
on the first page, but there was nothing recorded
in the news there that drew his attention
and he turned to the sports page, where football
dope stories could be found plentifully, for Bob
liked nothing better in the sports world than a
good football game.</p>
<p>The train conductor came in and sat down.</p>
<p>“It’s a bad night,” he said, looking at the
curtain of rain which swept the windows. “We’ll
be late getting into Jacksonville. A message at
the junction back there gave us a lot of slow
orders where the track is going bad ahead of us.”</p>
<p>“The rain must be worse farther south,” said
Bob.</p>
<p>“It’s nearly a cloudburst in some places. I
wouldn’t be surprised if we find a bridge washed
out and get hung up for hours.”</p>
<p>The conductor was silent for a minute. Then
he added, “I can’t figure out where that fellow
in lower nine went. Seems impossible that he
could have fallen off the train, yet he isn’t here.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>“I’m just as puzzled as you are,” admitted Bob,
“but I have a feeling that no harm has come to
him. I sized him up as a fellow pretty well able
to take care of himself.”</p>
<p>“I don’t recall seeing him,” said the train conductor,
“for the Pullman conductor handles this
end of the Limited. Well, I’ve more reports to
get ready.”</p>
<p>He got to his feet and started for the door. The
Limited lurched heavily and the conductor was
thrown back against Bob.</p>
<p>“There we go!” he cried. “The track’s gone
out from under us.”</p>
<p>The car was weaving and lurching as the
wheels screamed in the grip of powerful air
brakes, but the rhythmic clack of the trucks told
them they were still on the rails.</p>
<p>The conductor hoisted himself to his feet and
Bob followed him in a dash for the vestibule.</p>
<p>“That blamed engineer almost shook us to
pieces,” groaned the conductor as he threw open
the top half of the vestibule door and peered out.</p>
<p>Bob, looking over his shoulder, could see a red
glare that penetrated even the brilliance of the
locomotive’s headlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>“Someone’s swinging a fuse against us,” said
the conductor, buttoning up his slicker. “I’m
going ahead.”</p>
<p>Bob ran back into the Pullman and got his own
coat. Tully, who was awake now, wanted to
know what it was all about.</p>
<p>“An emergency stop of some kind,” said Bob.
“I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>By the time he was back in the vestibule the
Limited was grinding to a stop and Bob swung
down behind the conductor, the two running
ahead alongside the train as rapidly as they could
in the darkness.</p>
<p>The Southern had been flagged at a lonely way
station where it seldom if ever made a stop, and
the engineer, who was leaning from his cab,
bawled lustily at them.</p>
<p>“Find out what that hick agent means by
flagging us down,” he shouted. “We’ve got to
get rolling again. We’re 23 minutes late.”</p>
<p>The agent, the red fuse still in his hands, came
toward them and Bob caught a glimpse of a telegram
in one hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>“What’s the idea of flagging us down?” demanded
the conductor. “I’m going to report you
if you haven’t a mighty good reason.”</p>
<p>The agent’s retort was sharp.</p>
<p>“Oh, quit your howling. I waved a fuse at you
because I had orders from the super to stop this
train and deliver a message to one of your passengers.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” bellowed the conductor. “You
had the nerve to stop the Southern just to deliver
a telegram?”</p>
<p>The agent shrugged. “You heard me. Now
I’ve got to find this passenger and deliver the
message.”</p>
<p>“Give it to me. I’ll deliver it.” The conductor
reached for the telegram, but the agent backed
away.</p>
<p>“Oh, no you don’t. I’m going to deliver this
in person and get the signature of the man I deliver
it to.”</p>
<p>“Hurry up there!” It was the engineer, shouting
at them above the noise of the storm and the
air pumps on the locomotive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>“Who’s the telegram for?” asked the conductor.</p>
<p>“Bob Houston in lower five, car 43,” replied
the agent. “Let’s get going.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, I’ll sign for the telegram,”
said Bob. “My name is Houston and I’m in lower
five, car 43.”</p>
<p>The agent looked suspiciously at him as
though he had not expected anyone as youthful
looking as Bob.</p>
<p>“I’ve got instructions to see a certain badge
before I turn over this message,” he said.</p>
<p>Bob reached into his inner coat pocket, drew
forth his billfold, and produced the badge.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” nodded the agent. “Sign this
slip.”</p>
<p>He produced a pencil and Bob, writing in the
light from the headlight, signed his name.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said the agent. Then he turned to
the conductor. “All right. Now you can tell
that hoghead up there to pick up his wheels and
get the string of varnished gondolas out of here.
I want to go to sleep.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>The conductor snorted, but he was too anxious
to get back to his train to make a reply.</p>
<p>The vestibule of the forward coach had been
opened by the brakeman. They climbed aboard
and the engineer whistled off the moment they
were on the train.</p>
<p>Bob looked at the damp envelope in his hands
and suddenly he felt himself shaking slightly.
For some reason the Southern Limited had been
stopped at a lonely railroad outpost to deliver
this message to him. That it was important there
could be no doubt for he had been forced to
identify himself before he could obtain the message.</p>
<p>The coach was less than half full and Bob
dropped down in the nearest seat and ripped open
the telegram, looking first at the signature. It
was from Waldo Edgar, chief of the division of
investigation.</p>
<p>Bob read the message quickly and thoroughly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>“This is to warn you that a man known as Joe
Hamsa, traveling south with you on Limited, is
now believed linked with gang we want. Watch
Hamsa closely and take no chances with him as
his record is a ruthless one. In view of this, contact
Merritt Hughes and Condon Adams when
you reach Jacksonville.”</p>
<p>Bob read the telegram again, folded it carefully
and placed it in an inside pocket with the
feeling that even though Joe Hamsa had disappeared
from the train, they would meet and that
their meeting would not be far in the future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter X</span></span>
<br>IN CAR 43<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob walked back through the Southern
Limited with many things running
through his mind. His suspicions concerning
Joe Hamsa had been confirmed by the
telegram in his pocket.</p>
<p>The rôle of diamond salesman was an ideal
one for Hamsa to assume. In that capacity he
would be able to go around the country selling
the smuggled diamonds and if he appeared to be
working for a legitimate firm of wholesale diamond
merchants there was little doubt that he
would go unmolested by the federal agents.</p>
<p>Bob wondered just how the department had
obtained the information on Hamsa which had
led to the telegram to him. Perhaps his uncle
would be able to enlighten him when he arrived
in Jacksonville the next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>The young federal agent entered car 43 and
stopped at lower five. He parted the curtains
and looked down at Tully, who was sound asleep.
Tully was breathing so deeply that Bob hesitated
to awaken him and tell him about the message.
If Tully was still asleep when Bob went
to bed, there would still be time to awaken him.</p>
<p>Bob went on back to lower nine, which Hamsa
was to have occupied. There was nothing on the
seats, but Bob caught a glimpse of a bag sticking
from under the forward seat and he leaned down
and pulled a small bag out.</p>
<p>The case was of well worn brown leather securely
fastened with two small but sturdy padlocks.
There was something soft inside, but the
leather was too thick for his fingers to ascertain
just what the contents might be.</p>
<p>The porter came through the car and stopped.</p>
<p>“Haven’t seen anything more of the man in
lower nine?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>The Pullman employe shook his gray head.</p>
<p>“No sir, and I don’t know whether to make up
his berth.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>“You might as well save yourself work. I
don’t believe I’d make it up,” advised Bob, and
the porter, deciding to accept the counsel, went
on up the aisle.</p>
<p>Bob walked back to the observation and lounge
car. There was only one passenger who had not
retired to his berth in the forward Pullmans. He
was an elderly man, thin, but with an expression
on his face which gave one a feeling of tremendous
vitality. He was deeply engrossed in
reading and Bob picked up a newspaper which
had been brought aboard the train at one of the
Carolina towns.</p>
<p>But he found reading a difficult task. His mind
was centered on the disappearance of Hamsa. It
seemed absolutely incredible that a man could
have vanished from a fast train while it was
speeding through the night between stations.
Yet apparently that was just what had taken
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Bob knew there was an answer to the problem,
and it was probably something ridiculously
simple, but it evaded his every mental effort and
he finally turned to the comic page of the newspaper
for a chuckle or two at the antics of the
comic characters.</p>
<p>The other passenger in the car put down the
magazine he had been reading and went forward
to his berth in another car. Bob was alone in the
observation lounge without even a trainman in
the car.</p>
<p>From up ahead the dismal hoot of the locomotive
whistle drifted back and seconds later the
car lurched as the trucks crashed over the frogs
of a siding and the dimmed lights of a village
drifted by in the storm. Then the train was in
the heart of the desolate night once more.</p>
<p>After the events of the afternoon, with Tully’s
sudden collapse and the disappearance of Hamsa,
it was not a scene to inspire confidence in the
heart of any young federal agent and Bob felt a
queer chill running up and down his spine. Once
or twice before, when sudden danger impended,
he had had the same feeling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Some premonition caused Bob to turn quickly
toward the forward end of the observation car
and his eyes riveted on a hand, extended around
the edge of the corridor, which was groping for
the switches controlling the lights inside the car.</p>
<p>Bob was motionless, but for only a second.
Then he leaped forward, his powerful legs driving
him ahead as the groping hand finally found
the switch and he saw the fingers tense as they
started to move the lever downward which would
plunge the car into darkness.</p>
<p>A blanket of darkness engulfed the interior of
the observation car and Bob heard the faint click
of the switch. His body was hurtling forward
with a momentum impossible to stop and he
crashed almost headlong into the steel partition
at the end of the car.</p>
<p>Bob was dazed by the shock of the impact and
he dropped to the floor, too bruised to move for
a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Then a finger of light sought him out. The
tiny ray was almost blinding in its brilliance and
the beam swept Bob’s face as he struggled to get
up. He was on his knees and facing the mysterious
beam when there was a sharp blow on his
face. The impact was not hard, but there was
no mistaking that he had been struck.</p>
<p>A sudden nausea swept Bob and he felt his
power of control ebbing rapidly. He tried to
cry out, but his tongue seemed to swell and stick
in his mouth. His arms dropped at his sides and
he felt his knees wobbling. In spite of everything
he could do he collapsed on the floor of the observation
car.</p>
<p>The last thing Bob remembered was the thin
beam of light which still sought him out with
relentless steadiness and then a mocking laugh,
heavy and daring, that might easily have come
from the lips of Joe Hamsa had he been on the
Southern Limited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XI</span></span>
<br>DOUBLE DANGER<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob never knew just how long he was unconscious,
but it must have been at least
half an hour before his mind started to
clear and he felt some one shaking his shoulders.</p>
<p>His head pounded painfully and it was difficult
for him to lift his heavy-lidded eyes. Some one
moistened his lips and his tongue felt better. He
tried to talk, but some one cut him short.</p>
<p>“He’s coming around now. Lift him into a
chair.”</p>
<p>The command was obeyed and Bob felt himself
being carried into a chair. Faintly he heard
the steady clack of train trucks and he knew that
he was still on the Southern Limited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>When his eyes finally focused and his blurred
vision cleared he saw the train conductor leaning
over him. A Pullman porter was just behind and
in the background another trainman could be
seen.</p>
<p>“What happened?” It was the voice of the
train conductor.</p>
<p>Bob shook his head. He was still too weak to
answer that question, but his eyes shot toward
the end of the car as though he half expected to
see a hand move around the corner and grope
for the light switch. In his ears the mocking laugh
he had heard still echoed.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” asked the young federal
agent, and when the conductor answered Bob
knew that the Limited was far behind its usual
fast schedule into the southland.</p>
<p>Bob looked sharply at the trainmen.</p>
<p>“Have you seen anything of the man in lower
nine in the last hour?” The question was sharp
and he saw the look of surprise that passed over
their faces.</p>
<p>Denials were quick and emphatic. Quite
definitely they had not seen Joe Hamsa on the
Limited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Bob shook his head. That was strange for he
was sure that it was Hamsa’s voice he had heard
in the car just before he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>“Tell us what happened,” urged the train conductor,
who was more than a little disturbed at
the misfortunes which were befalling the passengers
on the Limited that night. One federal agent
had been taken suddenly ill, another passenger
had disappeared, the train had been flagged down
at a lonely station for a telegram, and now the
second federal agent had been found unconscious
in the observation car. It was, admitted the trainman,
too much for him to untangle.</p>
<p>Bob felt more like talking now, and he told
his story briefly.</p>
<p>“I turned toward the forward end of the car
just in time to see some one’s hand groping
around the corner for the light switch. I jumped
for the switch, but the lights were snapped out
before I could reach it.”</p>
<p>Bob paused for a moment, then went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>“I crashed into the steel partition at the end of
the lounge section of the car and fell down. Before
I could get to my feet whoever had turned
off the lights snapped on a small but very brilliant
flash light and focused it on my eyes. Before I
could get to my feet there was a sharp impact on
my face. It was just as though some one had
struck me a sharp blow. After that a wave of
nausea swept over me and that was the last thing
I remember until a few minutes ago.”</p>
<p>The conductor’s worry was reflected on his
frank face.</p>
<p>“The flagman, coming back from the head end,
found the car in darkness and when he turned on
the lights he almost fell over you. I was pretty
worried, but the porter told me that you acted
like your friend this afternoon and I knew he
was coming around all right so it wasn’t as bad
as it might have been.”</p>
<p>“Just before I lost consciousness,” went on
Bob, “I heard some one laugh and I would have
sworn it was the voice of Hamsa, the man who
has disappeared from lower nine.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t have been,” declared the conductor.
“I’ve been all over the train and know he
isn’t aboard.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>“Then who could have turned off the lights in
this car?” demanded Bob and the conductor
shrugged his shoulders in bewilderment.</p>
<p>“I’ll be glad when we’re at the end of the
division,” he said. “This thing is getting my
nerves. Next thing I’ll be seeing ghosts. You fellows
must have eaten some tainted food.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s out. Neither my companion nor I
had a meal together before we got on this train
this afternoon and he was taken ill before the
evening meal was served in the diner.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” agreed the conductor. “Well,
you puzzle it out. I guess that’s your profession.”</p>
<p>Bob got to his feet. His legs were still a little
shaky and the porter hurried away for more
coffee. When it was brought Bob drank two
more cups of the hot liquid, then he walked up
and down the car several times.</p>
<p>“If you can rustle up a sandwich out of the
diner, I’ll feel better when I get some more food
in my stomach,” said Bob, and the porter went
out to fill his request.</p>
<p>The conductor turned to the flagman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>“Don’t leave this car again, except when you
have to get off to protect the back end at flag
stops,” he ordered. “I don’t want any more
mysterious attacks on this train while I’m in
charge of it.”</p>
<p>Then he looked at Bob, who was still white
around the lips.</p>
<p>“Better get to bed and enjoy a few hours sleep,
young man. You’re starting to look like a fish
that’s been out of water too long.”</p>
<p>“I’m coming along all right,” declared Bob.
“As soon as I have a sandwich I’ll feel better.
I’m convinced that Hamsa is on this train some
place and I’m going to find him.”</p>
<p>The conductor stared at Bob as though he
thought the young federal agent was mentally
unbalanced. Then, shaking his head and muttering
to himself, he started forward to continue his
greatly interrupted work on his reports.</p>
<p>The porter came back with a tray on which
were two large, thick, meat sandwiches and a
glass of milk and Bob sat down in the observation
car to enjoy the late lunch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>The flagman, at the back end of the car, was
inclined to be more talkative than the conductor.</p>
<p>“Everyone on the train’s shaky tonight,” he
confided. “We got a message we picked up on
the run a few minutes ago and a fast freight that’s
been coming along right after us wasn’t able to
find any trace of Hamsa along the stretch of
road where we know he disappeared.”</p>
<p>“How fast were we running along that section?”
asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Never under fifty, and most of the time between
fifty-five and sixty-five.”</p>
<p>“Then a man wouldn’t have much chance of
jumping from the train without such serious injury
that he would be unable to get away?”
pressed Bob.</p>
<p>“I should say he wouldn’t. At the very least
he would get a broken leg and he wouldn’t be
able to get far from the right-of-way in that condition.
And remember that it’s been storming
hard ever since yesterday afternoon.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Bob knew that the trainman was right. It
would have been almost sure suicide to have
leaped from the speeding Limited and he was
more convinced than ever that Hamsa was somewhere
aboard the train.</p>
<p>“We’ve been over every car from head to rear
and back again,” said Bob. “Have you any idea
where he could hide?”</p>
<p>The flagman removed his cap and scratched his
head.</p>
<p>“He didn’t go through the baggage car?” he
asked.</p>
<p>“No,” replied Bob.</p>
<p>“How about under the steps in the vestibules?
Did you lift all of the traps?”</p>
<p>Bob’s startled expression was sufficient answer
to the flagman, who got hastily to his feet.</p>
<p>“No, we didn’t look under the traps,” admitted
Bob.</p>
<p>“Then we’d better get busy. We can do it
alone, working ahead through each car.”</p>
<p>The flagman started for the back end of the
train, evidently intent on checking the trap doors
on the observation platform when a sharp call
from Bob stopped him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>“Hamsa isn’t going to be an easy man to take
if he’s hiding under one of the traps. Wait until
I can go forward and get a gun out of my bag.”</p>
<p>“I’ll wait,” agreed the flagman, who obviously
had not thought that they might encounter armed
resistance.</p>
<p>Bob, running lightly, sped through the two
forward Pullmans and into car forty-three. His
own Gladstone was still under the berth in which
Tully was sleeping so heavily.</p>
<p>The young federal agent bent down and
dragged it out. He knew just where he had put
the gun and his hands sought it after he had
opened the bag. But the weapon was not where
Bob had placed it and a new feeling of anxiety
gripped him.</p>
<p>With desperate hands he rummaged through
the bag. The gun and box of cartridges he had
placed there were gone!</p>
<p>Bob picked up the big bag and carried it to a
berth further down the aisle where he snapped on
the seat lights. Once more his hands ran through
the clothing which filled the bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The revolver was gone, but the rifle he was
taking south with him was intact, although the
ammunition for it was missing. Some one had
looted the bag and in doing so had left Bob defenseless
against any armed attack.</p>
<p>The discovery that his own bag had been
searched so disturbed Bob that for a moment he
forgot the important confidential papers on the
smuggling case which he had placed there.</p>
<p>When he recalled them, he started another
search of the bag, turning clothes topsy-turvy in
his search for the envelope and the precious information
which it contained.</p>
<p>Bob searched both sides of the Gladstone with
a heart that grew heavier with apprehension as
each second passed. There was no question now—his
own confidential papers had been stolen.</p>
<p>His hands went to the inner coat pocket where
he had tucked the telegram warning them against
Hamsa. When he drew them out his hands were
empty. Even that message had disappeared and
Bob knew then, without question, that Hamsa
was somewhere on the train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>With the telegram from Washington in his
possession and the knowledge that the federal
agents were closing in on him, Hamsa would be
doubly dangerous and Bob was unarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XII</span></span>
<br>A NEW MYSTERY<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob sat in the berth for a time, thinking what
to do next. He was certain that Hamsa
was on the train and he knew that the
other was capably armed, for he had Bob’s own
revolver and there was no question but that he
would use the weapon if his hand was forced
too far.</p>
<p>Bob got up and walked back to lower five
where Tully was in a deep sleep. His traveling
companion’s bag was in the rack above his berth
and Bob reached in and pulled it out into the
aisle, letting the heavy curtains fall back into
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>He went through the bag methodically, for
Tully’s gun should have been there. Bob
searched every article in the bag twice, but the
hunt was fruitless. There was no weapon there.
Hamsa had done a thorough job of disarming the
federal agents.</p>
<p>Bob replaced Tully’s bag and then returned
to the observation car where the flagman was
waiting for him. He spread his empty hands in
an expressive gesture.</p>
<p>“Some one’s been through my bag and my
gun’s gone,” said Bob. “Whoever it was also
went through the other agent’s bag for he’s been
disarmed.”</p>
<p>The flagman’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“I’m not so keen about going on with this
search unless we’re armed,” he declared.</p>
<p>“Any guns of any kind on the train?”</p>
<p>“The baggage man up ahead has one, but I
don’t suppose he would loan it to anyone.”</p>
<p>“There’s no harm in trying,” decided Bob,
and he started forward through the train once
more.</p>
<p>The conductor was in the last coach forward
and Bob quickly explained what had happened.
The trainman went ahead and tapped on the
door of the baggage car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>It was opened cautiously and the baggage man
stuck his head out.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” he demanded gruffly.</p>
<p>“Let us in,” cried the conductor and they
stepped into the baggage car as a curtain of rain
swept down off the roof of the train.</p>
<p>Bob displayed his badge and then told what
he needed.</p>
<p>“I can’t let you have my service gun,” replied
the baggage man, “but I’ve got a .22 target pistol
I always carry along in my bag. You can have
that if it will do you any good.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty light. But it will be better than
nothing,” decided Bob as the baggage man obtained
the weapon and handed it to him.</p>
<p>“The only clip of cartridges I have for it are
in the gun,” he explained, “so be careful on the
ammunition if you get in a tight place.”</p>
<p>Bob and the conductor returned to the forward
coach.</p>
<p>“Which end of the train are you going to
start from?” asked the conductor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>“We’ll go back to the observation car and
work forward,” said Bob. “The flagman is back
there waiting for me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go with you. I want him to stay on the
back end and protect us if we have to make a
sudden stop. The track is getting soft and there’s
a fast freight that’s pounding along after us too
close for comfort. I don’t want them piling
into the back end of the Limited on a night like
this.”</p>
<p>It was late as they started back once more and
most of the passengers in the day coaches, curled
into grotesque attitudes on the seats, were asleep.
In the Pullmans the solid rows of green curtains
swung to and fro as the train sped southward.</p>
<p>Bob thought of the possibility that Joe Hamsa
might be hiding in one of the unoccupied berths,
but he knew that the train crew had made a
thorough search of each berth.</p>
<p>Standing a lonely vigil in the observation car
had done little to help the jumpy nerves of the
flagman and he was obviously relieved when he
found that the conductor had decided to help Bob
in the search of the vestibule steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>“Better turn down the lights in this car,” advised
the conductor. “All of the passengers on
the Pullmans are in bed.”</p>
<p>“Nothing doing,” insisted the flagman. “This
is one night when I want plenty of light in this
car and I’d just as soon have plenty of company
of the right kind. I thought I heard some one
moving around several times.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been reading too many mystery
stories,” jeered the conductor.</p>
<p>Bob led the way to the rear platform of the
train and they stepped out into the raw bluster of
the night.</p>
<p>The young federal agent took the target pistol
out of his coat pocket and slipped the catch off
the safety while the conductor focused the beam
from his flash light on one of the traps in the floor
of the vestibule.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The flagman, his foot poised to kick the catch,
saw Bob nod and the next second the trap door
swung upward as unseen springs provided the
momentum. They stared down at the empty
steps and the rays of the flash light, penetrating
even beyond, showed the ends of the ties as they
projected beyond the rain-swept ballast.</p>
<p>Down went the trap door and the flagman
turned to the other side of the platform. Bob
felt his heart beating harder. Actually he hardly
knew what he would do if the trap, flying upward,
were to reveal the hunched figure of Joe
Hamsa.</p>
<p>The flagman kicked the release lever and the
door sprung upward. Once more they stared at
vacant steps and an endless row of marching ties.</p>
<p>They returned to the observation car.</p>
<p>“Hope you have a nice party,” grinned the
flagman as Bob and the conductor started forward
to continue the search of the vestibule steps.</p>
<p>“Seems like kind of a foolish thing to do,”
grumbled the conductor.</p>
<p>“That may be, but I’m convinced that Hamsa
is still aboard this train and the vestibule steps are
the last place I can think of,” retorted Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Four more traps were opened without success
and they walked through another Pullman.
Finally they came to car 43, where Tully was
sleeping soundly. Their search at one end of
the car was without result and they walked
down to lower five.</p>
<p>One curtain in the berth seemed to be caught
and pulled back inward. It was this which attracted
Bob’s attention and made him pause. He
leaned over to adjust the curtain and just then
the train lurched sharply and he was thrown into
the berth.</p>
<p>Bob attempted to brace himself and keep from
falling on the sleeping Tully, but his efforts were
without avail and he dropped rather heavily into
the berth.</p>
<p>Bob expected Tully to cry out, but there was
no answer from the other young federal agent
and Bob, struggling to his feet, parted the curtains
and with the conductor peering over his
shoulder, looked in.</p>
<p>The bedding had been thrown carelessly to
the back of the berth and Tully was missing!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XIII</span></span>
<br>GOING ON<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob turned and stared at the conductor with
unbelieving eyes.</p>
<p>“He’s gone!” said Bob mechanically.</p>
<p>But it couldn’t be possible for only a few minutes
before he had looked in at Tully when he
had examined the contents of his bag in the search
for a weapon. Tully had been sleeping deeply
but peacefully then.</p>
<p>“Maybe he walked up ahead to get a drink,”
suggested the conductor. But there was little
actual hope in his voice that this had happened.</p>
<p>“Get ahead and see if he’s there,” ordered Bob
and the conductor hurried away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Bob threw back the curtains in the berth and
looked for some evidence of a struggle for he
was convinced in his own mind that Tully had
never left the berth of his own free will. For
one thing Tully had been too ill to get up and do
any walking on the train.</p>
<p>The conductor returned promptly. There was
no sign of Tully in the head end of the Pullman.</p>
<p>Bob rummaged through the sheets and blankets
on the bed and his hands suddenly came on something
firm. He drew the object out of the bedding
and gazed at it under the rays of the berth
light which he had turned on. It was a leather
covered blackjack.</p>
<p>“This spells trouble in capital letters,” said Bob
as he drew out a clean handkerchief and turned
the blackjack over. “Some one slugged Tully
and then carried him out of his berth. This train
is haunted.”</p>
<p>“I’m beginning to believe so myself,” agreed
the conductor. “Who could have carried him
away?”</p>
<p>“There’s only one answer to that—Hamsa,”
asserted Bob. “What I want to know is what
happened to Tully?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>The conductor shook his head in glum perplexity.
Events were happening too swiftly for
him to comprehend. First valuable papers had
been stolen, then a gun, and a federal agent had
disappeared from his berth. The trainman would
welcome the end of the division and his run.</p>
<p>The brakeman, coming back from the head
end on his rounds, stopped in the Pullman.</p>
<p>“One of you fellows leave the vestibule door
up ahead open?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” replied Bob sharply.</p>
<p>“Well, some one did. I closed it when I came
along.”</p>
<p>A look of apprehension flitted across Bob’s
face.</p>
<p>“Which vestibule was open?” he demanded.</p>
<p>“Left hand one on the car just ahead,” replied
the brakeman.</p>
<p>Without further questioning, Bob dashed
ahead, a mounting fear tugging at his heart.</p>
<p>The conductor and brakeman followed him
through the car and out into the vestibule where
the steady clacking of the trucks beneath the
Pullmans filled the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Bob stepped across the gap into the car ahead.
There was a splotch of water on the steel floor
of the vestibule where the wind had lashed the
rain in while the door was open.</p>
<p>“This the door that was open?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Right. I closed it less than a minute ago,” replied
the brakeman.</p>
<p>Bob dropped down to his knees and examined
the floor of the vestibule. At first there appeared
to be nothing unusual there, but his sharp eyes
finally caught sight of a small, dark spot. It
was soft and fresh and he touched it with his
fingers.</p>
<p>Bob drew his hand back where the light was
better and examined the dark marks on the tips
of his fingers. From behind came an involuntary
gasp from the brakeman.</p>
<p>The dark spots on Bob’s fingers were blood
and the young federal agent looked up at the
trainmen with eyes that were hard and piercing.</p>
<p>“Stop this train!” he ordered. “Tully Ross has
been thrown from the train. We’ve got to go
back.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The conductor was silent for a moment, staring
at the dark stains on Bob’s fingers. Then he shook
his head.</p>
<p>“We can’t stop and go back. There’s a fast
freight following right behind us and they might
ram us. We’ll have to run to the nearest station
with a night operator. Then we can get word
back to division headquarters.”</p>
<p>“But we’ve got to stop. He may be seriously
injured.”</p>
<p>The conductor looked at his watch. Just then
the air brakes went on and streams of sparks flew
from the wet trucks underneath.</p>
<p>“We’re slowing down now for Robertson
where we take on water. There’s a night operator
there. We can send a message back and get
new orders.”</p>
<p>The brakeman threw open the vestibule door
on the right side and almost before the train came
to a stop Bob and the conductor were running
forward.</p>
<p>When they reached the small station Bob dictated
the message and the conductor told the operator
to rush it through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>“That freight’s only ten miles up the line. It’s
at Quasqueton now. Maybe we can catch it,”
said the operator.</p>
<p>Bob nodded and the operator pounded his key
hard with a desperate call for the night man at
Quasqueton. It seemed ages before there was an
answer. Actually the Quesqueton operator answered
in less than a minute.</p>
<p>“Hold the freight,” snapped back the operator
beside Bob, and just then the dispatcher at division
headquarters chimed in and wanted to
know what it was all about.</p>
<p>The story was snapped over the wires as the
bent fingers of the operator at Robertson tapped
out the facts. The answer from the dispatcher
came sharply, first a message to the freight.</p>
<p>“To enginemen and trainmen of extra X703
South. Use all precautions in moving from Quasqueton
to Robertson to find federal agent believed
thrown from Southern Limited. Report immediately
upon arrival at Robertson.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>That message was followed by one to the Limited
to proceed. The night operator copied this
quickly and handed the thin tissues to the conductor,
who was buttoning up his coat before
going back into the desolation of that wild night.</p>
<p>“Going on with us, or will you stay here and
wait for the freight to come through and report?”</p>
<p>Bob hesitated. If he remained at the lonely
station he would have first hand information if
Tully was found by the freight crew. On the
other hand, he was convinced that Joe Hamsa
was still aboard the Southern Limited and that
he had on his person the confidential documents
on the smuggling ring which had been stolen
from Tully and Bob.</p>
<p>The decision was made quickly.</p>
<p>“I’m going on the Limited. What’s our next
stop?”</p>
<p>The conductor named a junction thirty miles
down the line.</p>
<p>“Will the freight be in here by the time we
reach the junction?” Bob asked the night operator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>“It will at the rate the Limited is running tonight,”
replied the operator. “Quasqueton is reporting
the freight out right now.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” called the conductor.</p>
<p>The trainman hurried outside and Bob banged
the door after him. The federal agent went back
to the Pullmans while the conductor ran forward
with the orders for the engineer. A minute later
the Limited hooted shrilly and once more started
southward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XIV</span></span>
<br>THE LIGHTS GO OUT<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Back in the Pullman from which Tully had
vanished Bob took off the coat which had
protected him from the storm. He sat
down opposite the berth and carefully examined
the target revolver. An eerie feeling ran along
his spine. He felt as though some one was watching
him and he turned and scanned the windows
of the Pullman. But that was impossible for the
Limited was already running better than thirty
miles an hour and no one could possibly have
clung to the side of the train.</p>
<p>The conductor came back through.</p>
<p>“I’m going to finish that search,” declared Bob,
and the trainman, without further comment,
joined him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Working together and moving cautiously, they
raised up the trap door on every vestibule clear
up to the baggage car. There was no one hidden
on the steps.</p>
<p>“If there was ever anyone there, he got off
at Robertson,” said the conductor.</p>
<p>But Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” he said firmly. “What
would a man stop there for? It’s miles from any
other town, and there are no good highways
nearby to make a get-away in a car.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re right, but there’s no one on
this train.”</p>
<p>Bob wasn’t so sure. A crafty man such as
Hamsa had shown himself to be could have
moved to the shelter of one of the rear vestibules
while the Limited was standing at Robertson
for Bob had checked these vestibules before the
train stopped there.</p>
<p>“I’m going to work from the front to the
back,” declared Bob, and the conductor looked
at him suspiciously as though thinking that the
strain of the night might have unbalanced Bob.
But he went along without complaint when the
federal agent started the hunt again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Car by car they inspected the train. The small
dark spot they had found in one vestibule had
dried and Bob didn’t dare think what might have
happened to Tully. While there was no love
lost between them, Bob had no desire to see any
harm come to the other.</p>
<p>As they entered the observation car, the Limited
started slowing down.</p>
<p>The conductor, pressing his face against one
of the rain-washed panes of glass, peered ahead.</p>
<p>“Junction showing now,” he said as Bob
stepped in after inspecting the trap doors on the
observation platform.</p>
<p>A red lantern was being swung at the junction
platform and the minute the Limited drew to a
halt beside the cinder platform Bob and the trainman
started running forward.</p>
<p>A night operator, swathed in a heavy storm
coat, greeted them.</p>
<p>“Message from Robertson for Bob Houston,”
he told the conductor. “Fine thing to make a man
deliver telegrams at this time of night.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The conductor didn’t bother to answer the operator’s
complaint but handed the message to
Bob, who tore open the envelope and read the
brief message inside.</p>
<p>“Man you reported missing found by freight
crew. Has cut on head and is bruised. Otherwise
appears okay. Proceeding on to junction aboard
freight.”</p>
<p>Bob breathed a sigh of relief for he was honestly
glad to know that no serious harm had befallen
Tully.</p>
<p>“Are you going on with us or will you stay
here?” asked the conductor.</p>
<p>Bob hesitated for only a moment.</p>
<p>“I’m going on,” he decided, for he knew that
Tully would be placed in good hands by the railroad
people and could proceed on alone to his
assignment as soon as he felt well enough. In
the meantime, Bob was still convinced that Joe
Hamsa was somewhere aboard the Limited for he
knew that Hamsa’s destination, like his own, was
somewhere along the east coast of Florida and
he felt sure that Hamsa would lose no time in attempting
to reach it. In view of that, Bob felt
the gangster would continue on the Limited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Two short, impatient blasts sounded up ahead
and the Limited jerked into motion as Bob and
the conductor swung back onto the train.</p>
<p>Bob had the borrowed revolver in one hand
and as he swung up after the conductor one hand
slipped on the wet handrail and he nearly fell. To
save himself he grasped the railing with the other
hand and dropped the gun just as the Limited
rolled over a small culvert. It was impossible to
stop and retrieve the gun and Bob was unarmed
for a second time that night.</p>
<p>“I guess the fellow you’re hunting has disappeared
for good,” said the conductor as he lowered
the trap in the vestibule.</p>
<p>Bob, shaking the rain off his coat, nodded
absent-mindedly and the trainman went forward
while Bob returned to the Pullman. A queer feeling
went through his body as he walked down
the silent car. It was from this car that their confidential
documents had disappeared and it was
from the very berth that Bob had intended occupying
that Tully had vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>The porter was evidently keeping as far away
from the car as possible for he failed to answer
Bob’s summons. However, a berth farther down
the car had been made up and Bob decided to
slip off his shoes and lie down there to rest.</p>
<p>With a little relaxation he might be able to
think better; perhaps even to unravel all of the
strange events which had taken place on the train
since it had left Washington.</p>
<p>The Limited sped southward steadily and the
clicking of the trucks soon lulled Bob to sleep in
spite of his efforts to keep awake.</p>
<p>The young federal agent had no idea how long
he had been asleep when he awoke suddenly with
the breathless blackness of the car all around him.
He rallied his thoughts.</p>
<p>The lights in the car had been on the last he
could remember, for he had not drawn the curtains
of his berth.</p>
<p>Bob sat upright in the berth and waited. The
trucks were still echoing the pace of the train
and Bob thought that the porter might have
snapped the wrong switch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Then he heard a movement down the aisle and
knew instantly that some one was in the car.</p>
<p>Could it be Hamsa? That was the first question
that flashed through Bob’s mind.</p>
<p>The federal agent gathered his feet beneath
him. There wasn’t even time for him to grope
under the berth in quest of his shoes for he could
hear the stealthy approach of the intruder.</p>
<p>Bob strained his eyes in an effort to detect
the movement of the marauder but the darkness
of the car was too dense. He could only wait,
but he felt that he had an advantage now, for
he would be able to take the other by surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XV</span></span>
<br>IN THE AISLE<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>The Limited heeled sharply as it struck a
curve and the whistle moaned a warning
through the wetness of the night. A
street light flickered by and in the flash of light
that penetrated the car Bob caught a fleeting
glimpse of a man in the aisle. The figure of the
intruder was heavy and he was hunched forward.
There had been no chance to recognize
the face, but Bob was sure now that the other
man in the car was Hamsa.</p>
<p>Another street light shot a beam through the
windows and it played squarely on the face of
the man in the aisle. It was Hamsa!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Bob felt in his coat pockets for something to
defend himself and his groping hands came on
the blackjack which Hamsa had used on Tully.
There was the grim hint of a smile on Bob’s lips
as he slipped his right hand through the leather
thong on the leaden slug. He now had both an
effective and dangerous weapon and he knew he
would be justified in using it.</p>
<p>Once more there came the streak of light in
the car as the Limited roared over another crossing
and Bob saw that Hamsa was nearer, almost
at the head of the berth.</p>
<p>With his muscles tense and his whole body
balanced, Bob waited for another flash of light
from the street which would give him an opportunity
to strike down the intruder. Then the
clatter of the trucks over switch points told him
the train was out of the village. Whatever happened
from that point on would probably be in
utter darkness unless the porter happened to
come back into the car and turn on the lights.</p>
<p>The Limited settled down to its steady stride
again and Bob, tense and crouching waited. His
breath was coming in short jerks and he was afraid
that his heart was pounding so hard its beats
would be audible to the other who was intent
on catching him by surprise in the darkened berth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>By straining his eyes Bob finally made out the
approaching shadow that was Hamsa. He drew
back his right arm and waited.</p>
<p>Hamsa came nearer, treading cautiously lest
he alarm the youth he believed was sleeping
soundly in the berth.</p>
<p>Suddenly a beam of light shot out from Hamsa’s
hand as he turned on a flash light, but the
rays fell only on the rumpled bedclothes.</p>
<p>Bob heard a smothered exclamation from the
other and before Hamsa could swing the beam of
the flash light around in search of him he struck
forth with the blackjack.</p>
<p>Just as Bob swung the weapon the trucks hit
a sag in the track and the young federal agent
was thrown partially off balance. He had aimed
at Hamsa’s head, and although his blow missed
that the weapon crashed down on his shoulder
and Bob heard a sharp cry of pain.</p>
<p>He jerked back the weapon and struck again
and again. Each time he heard a cry of pain and
then the flash light thudded to the floor and its
beam went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>They went at it hand to hand then, Hamsa
wresting the blackjack away from Bob and hurling
it to the far end of the car. The other man
was much older and twice as heavy as Bob, but
he was not as lithe and his fists could not move as
rapidly.</p>
<p>It was a bitter struggle there in the narrow,
darkened aisle of the Pullman. Hamsa kicked out
viciously and the blow caught Bob in the stomach.
He felt sick all over and dropped into the
aisle, crouching there and seeking temporary shelter
until he felt able to resume the battle.</p>
<p>Hamsa bent down and searched for the flash
light and Bob lashed out at him with one foot.
The blow caught the other in the face and was
answered by a startled exclamation of pain and
rage.</p>
<p>Then Bob’s own hands came upon the flash
light. He picked it up and his fingers sought the
little button which controlled its beam of light.
Bob turned on the light and the rays swept down
the aisle, coming to rest on the battered face of
Hamsa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>It was not until then that Bob realized how
powerful had been his own blows for it was
obvious that his assailant was in distress. Now
if he could land a real knockout he would be able
to leave Hamsa long enough to summon assistance
from the trainmen.</p>
<p>Bob started down the aisle, but pulled up short
when Hamsa drew a gun from his coat pocket.
The young federal agent, unarmed, was in no
position to face a man with a gun and he tried
to duck behind a seat. But Hamsa fired a snap
shot and the flash light, shattered by the bullet,
dropped out of Bob’s numbed hand.</p>
<p>The tables had been turned. Where Bob had
held the advantage a moment before with the
flash light, Hamsa, aided by the darkness and
his gun, was in a position to win.</p>
<p>But he had evidently had enough of hand to
hand encounters for one night and Bob heard
him running toward the rear of the car. A moment
later the door of the Pullman slammed shut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Bob stepped out into the aisle and massaged his
right hand. It prickled sharply as the blood
flowed back into the fingers which had been
bruised by the flash light as the bullet had torn
it out of his hands.</p>
<p>Then Bob took up the chase, for he felt sure
that Hamsa must be seeking his hideout on the
train. If he could trace him to it, he would summon
the trainmen to assist in the capture.</p>
<p>Bob stepped cautiously into the rear vestibule
of the car. There was no one there and the door
to the next Pullman was open. He hastened inside
and met a startled porter in the aisle.</p>
<p>“Did a man just go down the aisle?” asked
Bob.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, Boss, and he looked like he’d been
in a fight.”</p>
<p>“That’s the fellow I’m after,” said Bob. “Run
up ahead and get the conductor and any other
trainmen you can. Tell them to get back here as
fast as they can.”</p>
<p>Then Bob hastened down the aisle and the
porter, willing enough to leave the car, went forward
to carry out Bob’s instructions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>The young federal agent hastened through a
second Pullman where the lights were low and
finally stepped into the observation car. So far
there had been no trace of Hamsa and no indication
that he had sought shelter under one of the
trap doors in the vestibules.</p>
<p>Bob entered the observation car cautiously.
The lights had been turned down and he stopped
at the head end of the car and snapped on all of
the switches, a torrent of light illuminating the
interior of the car. Even the observation platform
at the back end leaped into view as a special
light out there came on under the magic touch of
the switches.</p>
<p>Bob stared hard at the back of the car. The
door to the observation platform was open but
beyond that he could see a man’s legs dangling,
apparently in midair. Bob threw caution aside
then and raced toward the half open door at the
rear of the car. The legs were being drawn upward,
twisting and kicking as the man attempted
to pull himself onto the roof of the observation
car. This then was Hamsa’s hiding place—on
the roof of the rear car of the train!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XVI</span></span>
<br>FIGHTING FOR LIFE<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob leaped through the door and grabbed at
Hamsa’s legs. The other man kicked viciously,
but Bob wrapped his arms around
the legs and hung on. Once he had a good grip,
he started pulling the other man down.</p>
<p>Hamsa was big and he was powerful, but the
steady pull from below weakened his grip on
the steep rungs of the ladder which led to the
top of the car and Bob could feel himself gaining.
In less than a minute the other man would be
down on the platform beside him and by that time
the trainmen should be on hand to help him subdue
Hamsa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>There was a strange exultation in Bob’s heart
for he felt sure now that he was about to make
the first capture in what he felt was to be the
clean-up of the international gang of smugglers.
It made little difference whether Hamsa had
been trailing them south or whether they had encountered
each other by accident. The message
from Washington had indicated that Hamsa was
deeply involved and Bob was determined to make
the capture.</p>
<p>The steady pull Bob put on Hamsa’s legs and
the tightness of his grasp was relentless. Slowly
the other man was weakening and Bob braced
himself and prepared to release Hamsa’s legs and
cut loose with a half dozen hard punches when
the other man finally dropped to the observation
platform.</p>
<p>There was a commotion at the head end of the
car and Bob shifted his head just enough to see
the train conductor and brakeman, followed by
a wide-eyed Pullman porter, hurry in.</p>
<p>Hamsa kicked convulsively with his legs, but
Bob tightened his grasp. Then, without warning,
without giving Bob a chance to get set,
Hamsa suddenly released his hold and dropped.
It all happened so quickly that Bob later found it
a little hard to remember just what took place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>On the split second while he was dropping to
the observation platform, Hamsa must have seen
the trainmen charging down the aisle of the car,
for when he landed, he was a bundle of tremendous
energy that seemed to explode in Bob’s
face.</p>
<p>Great, bear-like arms wrapped themselves
around Bob and the young federal agent felt
himself being lifted upward. For a moment he
was helpless, too surprised even to attempt to
struggle, but a sharp cry from behind him caused
him to try to strike out with his feet for beneath
came the sudden rumble of the trucks on a trestle
and he knew that Hamsa, in a last desperate effort,
was attempting to hurl him from the rear
platform of the train.</p>
<p>The young federal agent wrapped his own arms
around Hamsa and clung to him desperately.
If Bob went, Hamsa would go with him. Of that
he was certain. The rail of the platform struck
Bob’s hips and he felt himself being forced backward.
It was sickening to hear the rumble of the
trestle beneath and a flood of rain beat down on
his face, drenching the upper half of his body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Then Hamsa gave one last, tremendous shove
and Bob knew that he was going over the edge
of the railing, but Hamsa was going with him.
The speed of the Limited had slackened, but it
was still doing at least twenty miles an hour when
Bob and Hamsa, locked arm in arm, went over
the rear platform. Bob closed his eyes for the
shock of striking the trestle would be terrific.
If he could only remain on the bridge there would
be some chance of rescue for the trainmen had
seen them go over the back end and would hurry
back in a searching party.</p>
<p>As they left the train, Bob managed to get one
last twist with his toes and as they fell, he was
on top. The drop from the train to the trestle
seemed endless. The clatter of the train trucks
had dimmed, but a whistle up ahead was blaring
an alarm.</p>
<p>Then they struck the trestle—struck it hard
and rolled over once. The fall dazed Bob, but
through his foggy mind he could hear the rush
of water somewhere below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Hamsa had rolled away from him but it was
too dark to see just where and Bob clung to the
wet steel of one of the rails. He was too weak
and shaken to think of attempting to get to his
feet and back of him he could hear the shriek of
the air brakes as they clamped down on the
wheels of the Limited and brought the Southern
to an emergency stop just beyond the edge of
the long trestle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XVII</span></span>
<br>INTO ANGRY WATERS<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob ached in every muscle and he wondered,
as he lay there on the trestle with the rain
beating down on him, if the dangers of
being a federal agent were worth the rewards.
Then he swept that thought aside. Of course it
was worth it, for he was on the side of right
and honor—a side for which many a sacrifice
could be willingly made.</p>
<p>As he lay on the bridge, trying to rally his
senses and waiting for enough strength to flow
back through his body to enable him to sit up,
Bob’s eyes became more accustomed to the rain
and the night. He tried to pick out the form of
Hamsa, who must be close to him, for the other
man had been underneath when they fell. The
shock had been severe enough for Bob and he
wondered if the other had been seriously injured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Finally Bob’s straining eyes picked out the
form of the other man. He was some feet away
and beyond the outside rail of the trestle—on the
very edge of the bridge where a false move would
plunge him into the rushing waters below.</p>
<p>Bob tried to move, but he was still too weak
and Hamsa was a dozen feet away. He wanted
to reach him and pull him away from the edge.</p>
<p>Someone at the end of the bridge was shouting
and Bob turned his head to see a group of trainmen,
lanterns in their hands, making their way
out on the long trestle. They were coming cautiously
for the long rain had made the timbers
slippery and treacherous.</p>
<p>As the trainmen moved out on the bridge,
Bob’s eyes went back to Hamsa. To his surprise
the other man was moving, struggling to sit up,
and Bob called out a warning.</p>
<p>“Don’t move, Hamsa!” he ordered. “You’re
under arrest. Stay where you are or you’ll fall
off the bridge.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>There was no reply from the other, but he continued
his struggle to sit up and Bob tried to drag
himself closer to the man he had placed under
arrest. There was no strength left in his own
arms or legs and he could go only a foot or
two.</p>
<p>The glow from the lanterns of the approaching
trainmen now penetrated the blackness and Bob
could see Hamsa’s face turned toward him.</p>
<p>“You’re clever, Kid,” growled the other, “but
you’re not going to arrest me this time. I’ll see
you later and when I do, watch out!”</p>
<p>Then the other turned and deliberately rolled
to the edge of the trestle.</p>
<p>“Hamsa, you’re under arrest!” cried Bob. But
he knew the words were futile for the only reply
was a mocking laugh. Then Hamsa disappeared
over the edge and seconds later there was the dull
splash of a heavy body striking the water. Bob
thought he heard the mocking laugh once more,
but he couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>Then the trainmen, led by the conductor,
reached the scene.</p>
<p>“Where’s the other fellow?” demanded the
conductor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Bob pointed to the darkness below.</p>
<p>“He just rolled over the edge,” he said.</p>
<p>The startled conductor went to the edge of
the trestle and swung his lantern over the side,
but only the rush of dark waters could be seen.</p>
<p>“That’s the last you’ll see of him,” he said.
“This stream is on a rampage and only a powerful
man could get to shore.”</p>
<p>Bob nodded, but he was not sure about the
conductor’s surmise that he had seen the last of
Hamsa for he was both a powerful and resourceful
man.</p>
<p>The trainmen helped Bob to his feet and assisted
him back to the Limited.</p>
<p>“I guess now you’ll be content to go to bed
and give us a little rest,” said the conductor when
Bob reached his own berth.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to get off a telegram first,” replied
Bob. “Give me the name of that stream and the
correct time.”</p>
<p>The conductor supplied the information and
Bob wrote a brief report of the night’s events
and addressed it to Waldo Edgar, the chief of
the division of investigation back in Washington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>“See that this message is dispatched at the first
stop,” said Bob. Then he turned, crawled between
the crisp, cool sheets, and dropped into
a deep sleep of exhaustion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XVIII</span></span>
<br>PICKING UP CLUES<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>When he awoke the Limited was pulling
into the train shed at Jacksonville and
his uncle, Merritt Hughes, was waiting
for him on the platform.</p>
<p>The older federal agent jumped aboard the
Limited before it came to a full stop and hastened
down the aisle to the berth where Bob, still the
only occupant of the car, was partially dressed.</p>
<p>“How are you, Bob?” There was real anxiety
in the question as Merritt Hughes looked down
on his capable young nephew.</p>
<p>“I’m a little stiff, but otherwise all right,”
grinned Bob. “My bag is under the berth. See
if you can find a clean shirt for me.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>“Never mind the shirt now. I want to know
what happened last night. We got only the briefest
word from Washington over the wires and
Condon Adams left before dawn for the hospital
up the line where they took Tully.”</p>
<p>“Is he all right?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“I understand he’ll have to stay in bed for a
couple of days.”</p>
<p>“What about the man we knew as Joe Hamsa?”</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes shook his head.</p>
<p>“There are no reports on him. There’s a large
searching party out looking along the banks of
the stream where he disappeared, but it looks like
we’ve seen the last of him.”</p>
<p>Bob wished that he could have had the confidence
his uncle displayed in believing that Joe
Hamsa was gone forever.</p>
<p>At his uncle’s urging, Bob recounted in detail
everything that had taken place after the Limited
left Washington.</p>
<p>“So Hamsa hid out on top of the observation
car?” mused the federal agent. “Well, that’s a
new one for me. No wonder you failed to find
him even though you went through the train
several times.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Bob motioned toward his bag beneath the
berth, “Now how about my shirt? Then some
breakfast, and I’ll be ready to go along on my
assignment.”</p>
<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind. You’re going
to spend the rest of the day in bed in my room
at the hotel. Tomorrow we’ll talk about your
going on to Atalissa. I’m not sure that I want you
to go there alone. It’s a tough little town. People
know too much there, but they won’t talk.
Either scared or in league with some illegal
racket.”</p>
<p>“And you figure the racket is the jewel smuggling?”</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes nodded gravely.</p>
<p>“This thing is big, Bob,” he went on. “As you
know from the confidential report you got, we
feel sure that only a few men are actually involved
in the ring, but they must be men of great
daring and resourcefulness, for they have managed
to elude some of the best detectives.”</p>
<p>“Then it seems kind of foolish for me to tackle
it,” said Bob, half to himself and half to his
uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>“Not at all. A new, younger man may have
some ideas that older men in the service would
not have. You’ve had one break in getting Hamsa
out of the way and we’re sure that he was linked
with the gang.”</p>
<p>“I guess there’s no question about that for he
stole the confidential reports Tully and I had.”</p>
<p>“Then what does that mean to you?” asked
Bob’s uncle.</p>
<p>The younger agent, struggling to button a shirt
collar that was too tight, stopped and sat down on
the edge of the berth.</p>
<p>“In the first place it means that he wanted to
find out just what the federal people knew about
the operations of the gang. Then it appears pretty
obvious that he didn’t want any more federal
men nosing around Atalissa and Nira.”</p>
<p>“Right in both cases,” agreed Merritt Hughes.
“Now what?”</p>
<p>“Well, it follows that there must be some
good reason for this interest in federal operations,
and all I can figure out is that the gang is getting
ready to smuggle in a large amount of gems.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>“Go to the head of the class; you’ve had a perfect
score. The question now follows, what shall
we do?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to try to demote me now?”
grinned Bob.</p>
<p>“No, I’m just trying to find out how far along
the way you’ll get by sound deduction and logic.”</p>
<p>“Then I’d say that we ought to go through
with our original plans and that Tully and I proceed
on to our assignments at once with additional
agents held ready to back us up if we get in a jam
or things break wide open and we need help.”</p>
<p>“You’re not worrying about Hamsa having
escaped from the river and getting word to the
others in the gang?”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m thinking about that angle, but
that’s a chance we’ll have to take,” replied Bob.</p>
<p>“We’ll make the decision tomorrow. There
may be some further advices from Washington
by that time.”</p>
<p>Bob finished dressing and his uncle picked up
his bag and together they walked out into the
train shed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>“Breakfast is going to taste good to me,” said
Bob. “Don’t waste any time in getting there.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll eat at the restaurant in the station,”
decided his uncle.</p>
<p>Breakfast was served quickly after they placed
their orders and Bob ate the meal with real relish.
Corn cakes with a thick coating of maple syrup
especially pleased him and he had a second order.</p>
<p>After the meal was finished, they walked
through the main waiting room of the station
and to the taxi stand just beyond where Merritt
Hughes signalled for a vehicle, and they were
soon speeding toward the hotel.</p>
<p>Bob, still stiff and sore from his encounter the
night before with Joe Hamsa, leaned back against
the cushions and enjoyed the trip, for this was
his first visit to Florida. The streets were broad,
the homes hospitable and life seemed to move at
a more leisurely pace than it did in the northern
cities with which he was familiar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The hotel, a modest sized structure, was done
in Spanish architecture and his uncle had two
rooms on the fourth floor looking down on an
inner court where there was a spacious swimming
pool flanked by stubby palm trees.</p>
<p>“Now for a shower bath and I’ll feel like I
really wanted to live again,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“I’ve got several reports to make out and mail
to the bureau in Washington,” said his uncle,
“and I’ll get them out of the way while you’re
taking your shower.”</p>
<p>Bob undressed and adjusted the spray in the
shower to his liking. For ten minutes he relaxed
under the soothing flow of the water and when he
finally emerged his muscles were not as sore and
tight and his head felt clearer. As he rubbed his
body briskly with a heavy towel, one thought
troubled him. What had caused the sudden illness
which had befallen Tully and later had
nearly struck him down on the train? While he
dressed, Bob told his uncle about these incidents.</p>
<p>“You say you felt something like a sharp blow
on the face before you became ill?” asked the
older federal agent.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Then you were gassed.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XIX</span></span>
<br>THE WARNING<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>“Gassed!” exclaimed Bob incredulously.</p>
<p>“Certainly. Tully got a full-sized
dose and you probably got only half a
one, which accounts for the varying degrees of
your illness and nausea.”</p>
<p>“But we couldn’t have been gassed,” replied
Bob.</p>
<p>“Oh yes you could. Modern crooks sometimes
turn to science to help them and I know as a fact
that small amounts of gas, which make the victim
desperately ill, can be obtained in thin glass
capsules. These capsules are so small they can
be flipped off the end of a finger or thrown in
some other manner with great accuracy. If they
strike near the nose, the impact shatters them
and the gas is released, causing a violent illness
which usually makes the victim unconscious.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>“That’s what happened,” cried Bob. “Why
your explanation fits perfectly, only I didn’t get
a full dose. Perhaps there was too much fresh air
in the car I was in.”</p>
<p>“The pellet of glass might have struck you a
glancing blow,” suggested his uncle.</p>
<p>“How can you defend yourself against this?”
asked Bob.</p>
<p>“The only safe way would be by a gas mask,
but now that you know such things can happen
you can be on the lookout. If you ever feel a
similar impact that arouses your suspicion, don’t
breathe, but rush to some other spot before you
take another gulp of air. That should enable you
to escape the gas.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to remember that,” promised Bob.</p>
<p>“Better take a nap now. After you wake up
you can type out your detailed report for Washington,”
advised Merritt Hughes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Bob didn’t especially relish the idea of sleeping
when he felt he should be on his way to Atalissa,
but he was thoroughly relaxed and a great
fatigue had crept over him. So it was with real
gratitude that he crept in between crisp sheets.
He was asleep in less than a minute. Some time
later his uncle looked in and pulled down the
shades at the windows. Later he went out for a
time, and when he returned Bob was still in a
deep sleep. It was late afternoon before Bob
finally roused from his slumber, but he felt much
like his former self. Of course there were a few
bruises and several strained muscles, but he could
walk without creaking in every joint.</p>
<p>Bob dressed and went into the adjoining room
which his uncle occupied. The federal agent had
gone out several hours before, but his portable
typewriter was on a low table and Bob sat down
and started to work on his report which was to
be air mailed to Washington.</p>
<p>The report was lengthy for Bob went into
great detail and the afternoon faded into early
night. He snapped on a desk light and continued
with his work. When he was through he straightened
up and stretched his arms for he had been
hunched over the typewriter for more than an
hour and a half.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Bob leaned back in his chair and read the report
with care, correcting an occasional error
which he had made in the manuscript. That done,
he addressed a large envelope, and went down to
the desk in the lobby where he secured air mail
stamps and learned that by prompt mailing the
letter would be delivered in Washington the next
morning.</p>
<p>Bob was hungry, but he waited for a time for
his uncle. Now that he was thoroughly rested,
he was anxious to make plans for the trip to Atalissa.
After waiting in the lobby for half an hour,
Bob went into the dining room which opened
to the right, leaving word where he could be
found.</p>
<p>A supper with a fresh fish steak as the main
course appeased his hunger and he ate leisurely.
A newsboy, walking through the restaurant, attracted
his attention and he purchased an evening
paper, scanning the headlines while he completed
his meal with a chocolate sundae.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Bob wondered if the reporters had been tipped
off by the trainmen as to what had taken place the
night before on the Southern Limited. He
searched every page of the paper, but there was
no mention of the disappearance of Joe Hamsa.</p>
<p>It was nearly mid-evening by the time Bob
was through with his meal and he returned to
the lobby, inquiring for any possible information
about his uncle.</p>
<p>“He left about four o’clock,” said the clerk on
duty. “I happened to see him step into the street
and he turned to the right. I’m positive he hasn’t
been back since then.”</p>
<p>Bob thanked the clerk for the information,
meager though it was. It would do no harm to go
for a stroll and he stepped out into the street.
Like his uncle had done, he turned right on a
street which led down to the water front.</p>
<p>He soon found himself in a poorer part of the
city. Street lights were far apart and their globes
dirty. Houses and shops seemed to be hiding and
the men who went along the street did not look
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Two policemen strolled by and Bob whistled
for he knew what it meant when officers made
their beat in pairs. He doubted whether his uncle
had visited this district and he turned and walked
back to the hotel.</p>
<p>A clock was striking ten when Bob re-entered
the lobby. He was almost at the elevators when
the clerk called to him.</p>
<p>“Telephone call just coming in for you,” he
said. “You can answer here if you wish.”</p>
<p>Bob hastened over to the desk. It must be his
uncle, phoning to tell him that he had been detained.</p>
<p>Bob picked up the instrument which the clerk
handed him and placed the receiver to his ear.
A gruff voice spoke, “Is this Bob Houston?”</p>
<p>It was a strange voice and Bob tried to catalog
its timbre, for it was pitched unusually low.</p>
<p>“This is Bob Houston speaking,” he replied
quietly.</p>
<p>“Then listen to what I’ve got to say. We’ve
got your uncle and we’ll get you and any other
federal men who attempt to trail us. Get off this
case and stay off if you ever want to see him alive
again and you can tell that to Washington.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XX</span></span>
<br>MEAGER HOPES<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Before Bob could reply he heard the receiver
on the other end of the line click. He
whirled to the hotel clerk.</p>
<p>“Any idea where that call came from?” he
asked.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Get the chief operator for me at once,” said
Bob, pulling out his badge to speed the clerk’s efforts.
To the chief operator Bob explained who
he was and what he wanted.</p>
<p>“Hold the line,” said the telephone official.</p>
<p>Bob leaned his elbows hard against the desk.
He needed the extra support for he had suddenly
gone weak all over. There had been grave menace
in the throaty voice which had come over
the wire and he did not doubt the truth of the
threat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>It was entirely possible that his uncle had been
captured by the smugglers they were trailing
and Bob knew, after his encounter with Hamsa,
that they were perfectly capable of using the
most drastic means to put out of the way any
obstacle to the success of their plans.</p>
<p>The chief operator spoke again.</p>
<p>“Your call came from a pay station in a drug
store near the water front.”</p>
<p>Bob obtained the name of the drug store and
he whirled away from the desk and ran outside
to the taxi stand. He jumped into the first
cab and gave the address of the drug store.</p>
<p>“Step on it driver. I’ll clear you with any traffic
officer that stops us.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that story before,” grunted the
driver as he shifted the gears.</p>
<p>“This talks,” said Bob, shoving his badge into
view of the driver.</p>
<p>“You said it, mister,” said the taxi man, and
the cab leaped ahead as he trod heavily on the
accelerator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>The cab wove in and out of a web of traffic,
then shot away down a dark street, took several
corners on two wheels, and after threading
through several narrower streets, drew up beside
a well lighted corner drug store.</p>
<p>“Wait here,” ordered Bob, jumping from the
cab and hurrying into the store.</p>
<p>Two clerks were on duty and Bob addressed
himself to the older man.</p>
<p>Motioning toward the telephone booth at the
rear of the store, he fired his first question.</p>
<p>“Give me a description of the man who put
in a call from here not more than fifteen minutes
ago.”</p>
<p>The man to whom Bob addressed the question
appeared to resent his intrusion, and his reply was
far from courteous.</p>
<p>“You’ve got the wrong place and besides I don’t
like you.”</p>
<p>That touched off Bob’s temper and his anger
blazed.</p>
<p>“Give me the information I want and give it
to me at once or you’re going on a quick ride to
jail. Who phoned from that booth?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>At the same time Bob revealed the metal shield
in his hand which identified him, and the entire
attitude of the clerk changed.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were a federal
man in the first place?” he grumbled.</p>
<p>“I want to know who made that call,” insisted
Bob.</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t pay a whole lot of attention.
There were a couple of other customers in the
store. He was kind of tall, and about thirty-five
I’d say.”</p>
<p>“What kind of clothes was he wearing?”</p>
<p>“He had on a coverall suit and a dark hat.”</p>
<p>“How about his hair and eyes. Was there
anything on his face that would make it easy to
identify him?”</p>
<p>The younger clerk spoke up.</p>
<p>“I noticed his low, deep voice,” he said, “and
there was a little scar just in front of one ear.”</p>
<p>“Which one?”</p>
<p>The clerk turned half away from Bob as though
assuming the position in which the stranger had
appeared to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>“It was the left ear,” he replied. “I’m sure
about that now.”</p>
<p>“Notice anything else about him? Did he appear
nervous or in a hurry to get away?”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t exactly nervous, but after he came
out of the booth he didn’t linger around.”</p>
<p>“Did he have a car?”</p>
<p>“No, he walked in here, but just after he left
I heard a motorboat getting under way. You
know it’s less than a block to the water front.”</p>
<p>There was no more information to be gained
from the clerks in the store and Bob returned to
the street where the cab was waiting.</p>
<p>“Roll on down to the water front,” he told the
driver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXI</span></span>
<br>SPECIAL AGENT NINE<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Along the river the docks appeared deserted
and there was not even a watchman in
sight. Bob returned to the cab.</p>
<p>“Wheel for the central police station and don’t
lose any time,” he commanded.</p>
<p>The cab shot away and Bob sank back into
the seat, his head in a whirl. Somehow, he felt
sure, the tangled threads would weave into a pattern
that he could solve, but he had to admit that
right now he was up against a seeming impasse.</p>
<p>The cab driver broke almost every speed record
in Jacksonville that night and more than once
they averted smashed fenders by the narrowest
of margins.</p>
<p>A police siren shrilled behind them and the
driver looked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Motorcycle cop coming,” he cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>“How far is it to the station?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Two blocks.”</p>
<p>“Then keep on going.”</p>
<p>The driver pressed the accelerator to the floor
boards and the cab leaped ahead, ran through a
red light in spite of the waving arms of another
traffic officer, and then shrieked to a stop before
the central police station.</p>
<p>Behind them the siren rose and then fell as
the motorcycle officer wheeled to the curb.</p>
<p>“Smart guys, smart guys,” he yelled. “Look
where you stopped?”</p>
<p>Grinning, he pointed to the sign which designated
the building as the police station.</p>
<p>“Just go right on in and make yourselves at
home. You’ll be there long enough. I’m going
to slap half a dozen traffic charges against you.”</p>
<p>Bob had no time to waste words with a traffic
officer.</p>
<p>“Come on in and place all of the charges you
want to,” he snapped, motioning to the taxi driver
to accompany him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Once inside the station, Bob hastened to the
main desk where a night captain was on duty.</p>
<p>“I’m Bob Houston, special agent nine of the
Department of Justice,” he explained, displaying
the badge which he held in his hand. “It was
necessary for me to reach here without loss of
time and the driver of my cab ran through some
red lights. Please see that any charges against him
are dismissed.”</p>
<p>The night captain nodded and waved the motorcycle
officer aside.</p>
<p>“Why all the hurry?” he asked.</p>
<p>“My uncle, a federal agent, walked out of the
hotel this afternoon and failed to return. A few
minutes ago I was warned that unless the federal
men were taken off a certain case, he would never
be seen alive again.”</p>
<p>“Think it was a fake threat?”</p>
<p>“No. It was serious enough. I traced the call
to a public booth in a drug store down near the
water front. The clerks were able to give me
only a fair description of the man who made the
call, but one of them told me a motorboat had
started down river shortly after the man left.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>“Any description of the boat?” pressed the
night captain.</p>
<p>“There was no one along the water front.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m afraid it’s going to be tough to pick
up that boat. It’s as black as pitch tonight, but
we’ll see what we can do.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to use a private room where I can
phone Washington,” said Bob and the officer
pointed to a doorway to the left and rear of his
own desk. Before he entered, Bob paid his taxi
bill and handed the driver a generous tip.</p>
<p>Once in the private room, Bob dropped into
a leather upholstered chair. Calling long distance,
he asked for a certain number in Washington that
was called only when something of the utmost
importance happened.</p>
<p>“Lines north are busy at present,” said the operator.</p>
<p>But the information Bob had could not wait
and he asked for the chief operator. In quick,
terse sentences he explained who he was and the
importance of his message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Faint clicking sounds could be heard in the
receiver, then Washington answered and Bob
knew that his call was being given the right-of-way
over everything else.</p>
<p>A quiet voice asked, “Who’s speaking?” and
Bob knew that he was in contact with Waldo
Edgar, the grim, efficient head of the government’s
greatest man-hunting division.</p>
<p>“This is Bob Houston. I’m at the central police
station at Jacksonville. Merritt Hughes, my
uncle, has been kidnaped within the last few
hours.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” There was explosive energy
in the question which was hurled back over the
wires.</p>
<p>Bob repeated his message, elaborating a little
this time.</p>
<p>“But Bob, that’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“I thought so too, at first,” confessed Bob, “but
after that warning phone call I changed my
mind.”</p>
<p>“Call your hotel again. I’ll hold the line.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Bob stepped outside and from another phone
got in touch with his hotel. There had been no
word about his uncle, the clerk assured him, and
Bob returned to the private room, where he relayed
the news northward.</p>
<p>He heard Waldo Edgar’s breath suck in.</p>
<p>“What have you done?” came the question,
and Bob was ready.</p>
<p>He told of his own attempt and added that he
had enlisted the aid of the Jacksonville police.</p>
<p>“That’s right as far as you’ve gone,” said his
chief. “Unfortunately a big kidnaping has broken
in the midwest and all of the extra men are concentrated
there. Condon Adams will be back in
Jacksonville shortly after midnight and you must
get in touch with him.”</p>
<p>There was a brief pause while the federal chief
mulled over plans for his next strategy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>“This isn’t going to be easy to do, Bob,” he
said, “but I’m counting on you going to your assignment
at Atalissa at once. This gang must be
about to pull off a really big job and I have a
feeling the disappearance of your uncle is a step
to keep federal men from concentrating further
south along the coast. Get all of the information
you can and turn it over to Condon Adams when
he arrives. Then you continue south and Adams
will take up the search for your uncle. As soon as
additional men can be spared, they will be sent
to aid you.”</p>

<br>A HARD ASSIGNMENT<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>It was a hard assignment to take, but Bob acquiesced.
He would have preferred to remain
in Jacksonville and search for his uncle,
but he realized the logic in Waldo Edgar’s deductions.</p>
<p>“Keep in close touch with me, Bob, and if it
looks like things are going to break down the
coast, we’ll get help to you. Keep your chin up
now, and give them all you’ve got.”</p>
<p>The receiver on the far end of the line clicked
and Bob hung up the instrument he had used.
The night captain stuck his head in the door.</p>
<p>“I’ve sent word to the coast guard to keep a
close watch for any unusual boat. Maybe they’ll
be able to turn up something.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t know it was an unusual boat,”
protested Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>“Well, we didn’t have any description and I
had to tell them something,” said the policeman.</p>
<p>They returned to the main desk. The night
captain was curious.</p>
<p>“Lot of federal men coming in?” he asked.</p>
<p>But Bob was noncommittal. He would be going
further south in a few hours and the search
for clues here would be turned over to Condon
Adams. One thing he did need, was a good revolver
and ammunition for the rifle.</p>
<p>He made known his wants to the night captain.</p>
<p>“It isn’t the usual thing, but I guess we can
fix you up,” said the policeman.</p>
<p>He called another officer to take charge of the
desk and led the way into a rear room where
there was a whole rack of guns.</p>
<p>“Look these over and take your choice.”</p>
<p>The night captain opened the case and Bob
tried half a dozen revolvers in his hand until he
found one that was balanced to suit him.</p>
<p>“This feels like a good gun,” he said. “I’ll
take it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>From another case the captain produced a generous
supply of ammunition.</p>
<p>“There’s a range downstairs if you’d like to
try your marksmanship,” he volunteered.</p>
<p>Bob knew that in the coming hours he might
find himself in a position where a trusty gun
would be a life saver and he accepted the captain’s
invitation.</p>
<p>His finger was steady and the pressure on the
trigger smooth. As a result he turned in a surprisingly
good score and the policeman whistled
when he saw the card Bob shot out.</p>
<p>“Good work, boy. Anytime you get tired of
this federal manhunting just let me know and I’ll
see that you have a job here.”</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot,” replied Bob. “I may have to
call on you if this case isn’t solved successfully.”</p>
<p>When they returned upstairs the captain rummaged
through the ammunition chest and finally
found some cartridges which would fit Bob’s
rifle. A shoulder holster was also borrowed and
Bob adjusted the straps so that it fitted neatly
under his coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>After thanking the night captain for his assistance,
Bob returned to the hotel. Another inquiry
at the desk revealed that there had been
no word from his uncle and Bob went upstairs.</p>
<p>His body was tired from the strain of the last
few hours and he took a warm shower, topping
it off with a cold spray that sent the blood tingling
through his body. Then he dressed in fresh
clothes and stretched out on the bed for a little
relaxation before going to the train to meet Condon
Adams.</p>
<p>Bob would have preferred to remain in Jacksonville
to lead the hunt for his uncle, but he
knew that Adams was both capable and ruthless
and when a federal agent was kidnaped, personal
feelings which Adams might have toward his
uncle would vanish.</p>
<p>Bob mulled over the preceding events and the
disappearance of his uncle strengthened his belief
that Hamsa had survived his fall off the trestle
and into the flood waters the night before. If
Hamsa had not survived, Bob doubted if his uncle
would have been abducted for he knew that
Hamsa would be afraid of the results when his
uncle and he got to comparing notes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>The feeling that some momentous activity by
the smugglers was under way grew as Bob lay
there on the bed. The leaders were desperate
and yet courageous enough to attempt to do away
with two federal agents and having failed to do
that had kidnaped a third.</p>
<p>Bob got up and scanned a map of Florida which
he had obtained. His finger ran along the coastline
until he came to Atalissa. Then he traced on
down to Nira where Tully had been assigned. It
was a desolate, sparsely inhabited section of the
coast—an area which in centuries before had probably
been a favorite hiding place for bands of
pirates who had roved the Spanish main. Numerous
indentations dotted the coast, offering ample
shelter to men who were afraid of the law.</p>
<p>With a start Bob noticed the time. It was after
eleven o’clock. He was taking no chances and he
adjusted the shoulder holster, filled the chambers
of the revolver with shells, and slipped on his
coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>At the desk downstairs he left word for the
clerk to take any message which might come for
him. Then he sped toward the station in a taxi.
When he arrived at the terminal he found that
the train Condon Adams was coming on was half
an hour late, for the tracks north were still soft
from the heavy rain of the preceding night.</p>
<p>Bob sat down to wait for the arrival of the
train and as the minutes slipped away he had the
feeling that he was under observation. The hair
along the back of his neck tingled and he wanted
to turn around and stare at those back of him.
Instead, he moved once or twice as though restless
and finally stood up, stretched, and strolled over
to the magazine stand, where he could turn
around and see the entire concourse.</p>
<p>Bob picked up a magazine and skimmed
through the pages with fingers that turned the
sheets mechanically while his keen eyes roved
over the room. Finally he came back to a lightly
built man who had been leaning against a radiator
somewhat to the right and back of the bench on
which he had been seated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>The man was dressed in a poorly fitted dark
suit, wore a cap, and moved restlessly. He was
the only one in the scattered gathering of people
in the station whom Bob would suspect of being
there to watch him.</p>
<p>Just then the lights flashed over an incoming
train board and Bob turned and walked toward
the train gates. Passengers started coming through
the gate and among the first was the bulky form
of Condon Adams. Bob called to him and Adams
turned aside.</p>
<p>“How’s Tully?” asked Bob, who was really
concerned over the condition of the young federal
agent.</p>
<p>Condon Adams’ face lighted up, for he was
genuinely fond of his nephew and Bob’s inquiry
touched a soft spot.</p>
<p>“Getting along fine,” he said. “Oh, he’s pretty
sore and all that, but he’ll be able to continue on
his assignment in two or three more days.”</p>
<p>“It was a tough break,” said Bob and Adams
nodded.</p>
<p>“What’s been going on?” he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>“Plenty,” replied Bob. “My uncle was kidnaped
earlier this evening.”</p>
<p>Adams dropped his bag and whirled to Bob.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” he demanded, as though unable
to believe the words.</p>
<p>“My uncle disappeared this evening and everything
points to a kidnaping by this gang of smugglers
we’re after,” explained Bob.</p>
<p>Condon Adams threw back his head and
laughed, but it was a grim sort of laugh that sent
chills down Bob’s neck.</p>
<p>“Well that’s good,” snorted Adams. “Merritt
Hughes, ace federal manhunter, kidnaped. I
suppose I’ll have to hunt for him now instead of
the kidnapers.”</p>
<p>“I guess that’s about the size of things,” replied
Bob slowly. “I’ve been in touch with Washington.
I’m to go on south to Atalissa on my
original assignment and you are to take up the
hunt here for him. I’ve already got the Jacksonville
police on the case. When Tully comes out
of the hospital, he is to continue to Nira as first
ordered.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>“Let’s get some coffee,” said Condon Adams
as they walked past the entrance of the station
restaurant.</p>
<p>The older federal agent slid his traveling bag
into a corner and dropped down into a chair.</p>
<p>“What a mess to get into,” he said, half to himself
and half to Bob. Then he looked up.</p>
<p>“Your uncle means quite a lot to you?”</p>
<p>Bob nodded. “You know he does. He got me
into the service and he’s pretty much of an older
brother to me.”</p>
<p>A waitress took their orders before Adams
spoke again.</p>
<p>“Then you know how I feel about Tully;
he’s kind of a kid brother to me. But that’s getting
away from what I started to say. Your uncle
and I have always been rivals in the service. One
of us would solve a good case and then the other
would win on the next one. He’s never liked the
way I got in through a little political help, but on
the whole I’ve done a pretty good job. Gosh,
I wouldn’t know what to do if anything happened
to him to take him out of the service.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>“He may be out for good now unless we can
find him,” said Bob bitterly.</p>
<p>“That’s just it, and Bob, differences are going
to be forgotten for the time. Why I wouldn’t
be happy if your uncle and I weren’t in some
kind of a scrap to see who could solve a new case.
We’ll find him and we’ll find him soon.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll work a hundred per cent on the
case?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Day and night,” promised Condon Adams,
reaching across the table to clasp Bob’s hand
firmly in his own and Bob knew that the older
agent was a man of his word and highly competent
in his own peculiar way.</p>
<p>Cups of steaming coffee were set before them
as well as the plate of doughnuts which Adams
had ordered. They attacked the lunch with a will
and Bob, draining his cup of coffee a few minutes
later, caught another glimpse of the slender,
slouching figure he had seen in the main waiting
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>“Don’t turn around,” he said to Adams, “but
when we get up, look at the little fellow in the
dark cap and suit. He’s outside looking in the
window. I had a feeling in the station he was
watching me.”</p>
<p>Condon Adams reached for the checks and
stood up. In reaching for his traveling bag he
was able to turn toward the broad glass window
and get a good view of the man Bob had described.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen him before,” said Adams, “but
he doesn’t look like a very savory character.”</p>
<p>He paid the bill for their lunch and as they
stepped out of the restaurant and looked for a
cab, the man in the dark suit sidled up to them.</p>
<p>“You guys federal men?” he asked.</p>
<p>Bob and Condon Adams whirled toward him.</p>
<p>“What of it?” barked Adams.</p>
<p>“I was just askin’. If you are, I’ve got a message
for you.”</p>
<p>“Who from?” it was Bob now.</p>
<p>The little man shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>“I don’t know,” he mumbled. “Fellow down
on the water front gave me a note to give to the
federals. Said one of them was at a hotel. When
I inquired there I learned he’d gone to the station
so I came along and thought I’d try you.”</p>
<p>He reached for an inner pocket and too late
Bob divined what was happening. The street
they were in was quiet now and suddenly there
was danger in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXIII</span></span>
<br>SNAP AIM SCORES<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Before Bob could reach for his own gun, the
little man had whipped a snub-nosed automatic
from a shoulder holster under his
left shoulder and his eyes gleamed in the dim
street light.</p>
<p>“How nice of you to tell me you were federals;
saved me a lot of trouble. Smart guys, aren’t you?
Well, get going toward that car on the other side
and don’t make any bad steps.”</p>
<p>A cold rage gripped Bob. They had fallen into
a neat trap and probably would soon be as helpless
as his uncle, who had been kidnaped earlier
in the evening. In the meantime, the smugglers
would have ample time to run in a large sum of
gems. Since they were willing to take the desperate
chance of abducting three federal men,
the amount must be tremendous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Condon Adams started to set down his traveling
bag, but a sharp command from the little man
stopped him.</p>
<p>“Carry that bag and carry it carefully,” he
snapped. “You guys are going for a long boat
ride.”</p>
<p>They walked rapidly across the street. In fact,
Bob was in a hurry to reach the car. For some
reason they had not been searched and if he could
get inside the sedan he might be able to slip the
revolver out of his shoulder holster. Condon
Adams lagged a little; perhaps suspecting what
was in Bob’s mind.</p>
<p>The door of the sedan opened as they neared
and Bob saw a man slouched at the wheel. There
was no one else in the car and Bob stepped into
the sedan, his muscles tense and his nerves cold.</p>
<p>“Stop!” the command was quiet but deadly
and Bob halted halfway to the seat.</p>
<p>“Back up and back up slow; I’m taking no
chances on gunplay.”</p>
<p>The driver of the car sat up quickly.</p>
<p>“Ain’t you searched them, Benny?” he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>“Shut up,” snapped the man on the pavement
and Bob, stepping back gingerly now, caught a
glimpse of the man with the gun. There was just
a chance of success for a desperate play and he
took the chance.</p>
<p>The gun in the shoulder holster was unfamiliar
as was the holster, but Bob was half hidden by the
darkness of the interior of the sedan. His right
hand, moving like a flash, grasped the butt of
the gun. Without attempting to pull it from the
holster, Bob simply elevated the muzzle and
pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>He fired by instinct as much as anything and
a flash of flame stabbed the night. On the echo of
the shot came a sharp cry and the man on the
pavement leaped backward, his own gun replying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Bob fired again and through the haze of smoke
and the acrid smell of burning cloth saw the little
man tumbling. The driver of the car swung
toward Bob, but before he could get into the
scrap, Bob jerked the gun from its holster and
clubbed him over the head with the barrel. It
was a savage blow, but he was dealing with men
who knew no mercy themselves. The driver
slumped forward in his seat and Bob, gun in
hand, leaped from the car.</p>
<p>Condon Adams, who had been able to draw
his own weapon, was leaning over the man on the
street.</p>
<p>“Great work, Bob. I thought they were going
to get away with this for a while.”</p>
<p>“Is he hurt badly?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think he’s going to be doing any
more mischief for a good long time. Your first
one caught his right shoulder and the second one
took his left leg—that’s what I’d call disabling a
gangster.”</p>
<p>“It was spot shooting. I didn’t have time to
aim,” explained Bob.</p>
<p>“Then I hope I’m not the target when you
really aim,” said the older federal agent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXIV</span></span>
<br>AT THE HOSPITAL<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>A policeman on duty at the station, attracted
by the shooting, came on the run and
Condon Adams flashed his federal badge.</p>
<p>“Get an ambulance and get this man to a hospital.
See that a heavy guard is placed at his bed.
We’ll take the fellow in the car down to the
central station with us and make a personal report.”</p>
<p>The federal men remained on the scene until
an ambulance arrived. In the meantime Condon
Adams had handcuffed the driver of the car, who
was now regaining consciousness. He pushed him
into the back seat, tossed in his own traveling bag,
and with Bob driving the car, they started for the
police station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>The trip was uneventful and they parked the
car in front of the station where a few hours before
Bob had telephoned the news of his uncle’s
abduction to Washington. The same night captain
was on duty and his eyes widened when he
saw Bob and Condon Adams with their handcuffed
prisoner.</p>
<p>Before the policeman could ply them with
questions Condon Adams explained what had
happened.</p>
<p>“Throw this fellow into a solitary cell; I’ll
question him after I get back from the hospital,”
he said.</p>
<p>“What charge shall I book him on?” asked the
policeman.</p>
<p>“Attempted abduction of a federal officer,”
snapped Adams, who then turned toward Bob.</p>
<p>“We’ll get over to the hospital now and see if
the fellow you clipped with a couple of bullets
is ready to talk.”</p>
<p>They hurried outside the station, but Adams
stopped short when he saw the sedan at the
curb.</p>
<p>“I forgot all about the car,” he said. “It’s probably
stolen. I’ll report it to the captain.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>By the time the older federal agent was back
Bob had a cab waiting at the curb and they told
the driver to speed them to the hospital.</p>
<p>“If we can get either one of these fellows to
talk, it may be the break that will open up this
case,” mused Adams as the cab roared along the
now almost deserted streets.</p>
<p>They pulled up at the hospital where a dim
light glowed over the entrance. There was no
general admittance at that hour of the night, but
continued ringing of the bell brought an orderly
and they gained admission.</p>
<p>Condon Adams revealed their identity to the
night supervisor and asked the condition of the
man who had been brought in.</p>
<p>“He’s resting fairly comfortably,” said the
nurse. “The bullet in his shoulder has been removed
and the one in his leg will be taken out in
the morning.”</p>
<p>“Case serious?” pressed Adams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>“I wouldn’t say so,” replied the nurse cautiously,
leading the way down the darkened
corridor to a room where the lights were aglow.
She opened the door and they stepped in, a nurse
who had been near the bed rising as they entered.
A policeman on the other side of the bed did
likewise.</p>
<p>“Don’t make him talk too much,” cautioned
the night supervisor.</p>
<p>Bob looked at the man who had attempted to
kidnap them. His face was thin and marred with
a sneer.</p>
<p>“You fellows can save your breath. I won’t
talk,” he said, an unpleasant whine in his voice,
and Bob catalogued him as a dangerous man when
armed, but one who was weak physically.</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that,” said Adams confidently.
“The boys down at the station are working over
the fellow who was driving for you. If you don’t
talk here, we’ll work you over when you get
out.”</p>
<p>Bob knew that was only a threat, but he was
interested in the reaction in the face of the man
on the bed and he saw a weakening of the lines
around the mouth as though the thought of
physical punishment was unnerving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Condon Adams must have sensed the same
thing for he advanced with a threatening gesture
of his fists and the man on the bed cringed away
from him.</p>
<p>“You can’t hit me,” he cried.</p>
<p>“Maybe not, but I’d like to,” scowled Adams,
and Bob knew that the older federal agent was
sincere in that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXV</span></span>
<br>BOB GETS READY<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Adams plied the wounded man with questions,
but all of the answers were evasive
and he finally turned to Bob.</p>
<p>“We’ll let him go for tonight. I’ll come back
and see him tomorrow and I’ll see him alone. I
can make him talk.”</p>
<p>They left the room after admonishing the policeman
on guard to remain on the alert for any
attempt to free the wounded man.</p>
<p>Out in the hallway Condon Adams confessed
to his disappointment.</p>
<p>“I thought maybe he’d break and talk. He’s a
weakling. I’ll get it out of him later.”</p>
<p>“How much later?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“That’s just it. I don’t know. It may be too
late to help in the hunt for your uncle.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Down on the main floor of the hospital once
more they telephoned for a taxicab and when it
appeared, gave the driver orders to go to Bob’s
hotel. They were silent on the trip back into the
heart of the city and when they reached the hotel
Condon Adams registered for a room on the same
floor as those of Bob and his uncle.</p>
<p>Bob went directly to his own room and made
a final inspection of the articles in his Gladstone
bag. The rifle and ammunition appeared intact
and he removed the revolver from the shoulder
holster, cleaned it carefully and refilled the
chambers.</p>
<p>After that was done he inspected his coat. It
appeared ruined beyond repair for the revolver
bullets had torn through the cloth and sparks
from the burning powder had extended the area
of the damage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Bob removed the suit he had been wearing and
got into the comfortable and rough and ready
corduroys which he had brought with him. He
laced up his boots and then adjusted the shoulder
holster, making sure that it would swing free in
case he faced any other emergencies similar to the
one which had confronted them a little more than
an hour before.</p>
<p>Condon Adams tapped on the door and then
came in.</p>
<p>“About ready to start for Atalissa?” he asked.</p>
<p>Bob nodded.</p>
<p>“I can get a southbound local at 3 a. m. After
about three hours I change to an accommodation
train that finally winds up at Atalissa somewhere
around noon. Not a very pleasant ride, but I
don’t want to attract attention either by breezing
in there in a car or a boat and as the roads are
none too good, I think the train is the best bet.”</p>
<p>“How about communications out of the village?
You may need help in a hurry?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t checked up on them,” confessed
Bob.</p>
<p>The older federal agent went to the telephone
and after a lengthy conversation with the hotel
clerk, secured the desired information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>“The telegraph office at the railroad station is
open from eight o’clock in the morning to five
o’clock in the evening. The phone exchange,
which seems to be pretty much of a one horse
affair, closes at nine o’clock in the evening. If
anything happens after that you’ll have to get the
operator out of bed in order to get a call through.
I’m making my headquarters here. Let me know
the minute anything turns up.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do that,” promised Bob, who, while he
could not exactly warm up to Condon Adams,
felt sure that the older man would bend every
effort toward the recovery of his uncle. “I’ll let
you know where I can be reached in Atalissa so
you can get news to me the minute Uncle Merritt
is found.”</p>
<p>Condon Adams glanced at his wrist watch.</p>
<p>“You haven’t much time to lose if you’re going
to make that southbound local.”</p>
<p>Bob looked at his own watch. It was 2:45
o’clock. He closed his Gladstone bag and tightened
the straps. Condon Adams walked ahead of
him into the hall and then as far as the elevator.</p>
<p>“Don’t take too many chances, Bob, and keep
your chin up. This thing is going to come out all
right.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXVI</span></span>
<br>“DON’T MOVE!”<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob wished that he could feel the confidence
of Condon Adams’ words as he stepped
into the elevator and dropped toward the
main floor. At the desk he turned in his room
key and then took a taxi to the same station
where earlier in the night, in company with
Condon Adams, he had captured two of the
suspected gem smugglers.</p>
<p>The young federal agent purchased his ticket
for Atalissa and the agent cautioned him about
the change at the junction. Then Bob picked up
his bag and walked through the now practically
deserted waiting room and out into the train shed
where a stubby, three car train was waiting for
the final call of “booo-ard” to start its jerking
journey southward. An express car and a combination
baggage and mail car were behind the
engine while the rear car was a dimly lighted
coach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Bob climbed up the steps. The seats were of
green plush, and halfway up the interior of the
car was a wooden partition which marked the
forward end of the coach as the smoking compartment.
There were only two people in the
rear half and Bob turned one seat over so a double
seat would be available. Then he stuck his ticket
in his hat band, folded up his corduroy coat for a
pillow, and curled up to make the best of the
lonely trip to Atalissa.</p>
<p>The federal agent had dropped into a light
sleep when the train started. He roused up long
enough to hear it roll over a bridge and then he
went back to sleep, failing to hear the conductor
when he removed the ticket from the band of
his hat.</p>
<p>The local jerked and stopped and then jerked
into motion again. This operation was repeated
a number of times, but Bob slept heavily through
it all, for his body was near exhaustion. It was
well after dawn when he finally moved and he
groaned softly as the blood started flowing once
more through his cramped legs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Bob sat up and massaged his legs and arms. It
was quite clear out now and the local was rocking
along a desolate stretch of Florida east coast.
Somewhere along the line the other passengers
had left the train and Bob was now the only occupant
of the coach.</p>
<p>He got up and walked to the water cooler.
Fortunately there was an ample supply of water
and after bathing his face and hands with the
cool liquid, he felt much refreshed though
ravenously hungry.</p>
<p>Up ahead the engineer blasted his whistle for
a highway crossing and Bob felt the air brakes
go on, the old wooden coach jumping around in
protest as the speed dropped sharply. They
clacked over switches and Bob, looking ahead,
could see a weather beaten station, on the other
side of which another train was standing. This,
he concluded, must be the junction.</p>
<p>The conductor, coming back from the baggage
car, gave Bob his train check.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>“Don’t have many passengers going to Atalissa,”
he said. “Them that wants to get there
usually go by car or boat.”</p>
<p>The local rocked to a creaking halt and Bob,
his Gladstone in hand, stepped down on the
cinder platform.</p>
<p>The accommodation which was to take him the
rest of the way to Atalissa was on the other side
of the station. The engine, an antiquated little
affair, looked about like a teakettle, but the two
freight cars and the passenger car on the back
end were standard size equipment.</p>
<p>The conductor, in faded blue overalls, looked
at Bob’s ticket.</p>
<p>“Guess you’re the only passenger,” he said.
“Well, we might as well be going.”</p>
<p>“How about breakfast?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Hungry?” asked the conductor.</p>
<p>“Just about starved,” confessed Bob.</p>
<p>“Well, we stop at Ainsworth about ten miles
down the line. There’s a little place there where
you can get a bite to eat.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>There appeared to be nothing else to do so
Bob climbed up the steps of the old wooden coach
and put his Gladstone in the first seat at the rear.
The engineer whistled a wheezy “high ball” and
the conductor swung up on the back end as the
accommodation started its daily run for the seacoast.</p>
<p>The air in the coach was stuffy and Bob found
it pleasanter on the rear platform, watching the
track wind away in the distance and they swung
around curves and chugged their way up steep
grades. It seemed incredible that in such a peaceful
appearing country there must be located the
headquarters for a relentless band of smugglers.</p>
<p>The second stop of the accommodation that
morning was at Ainsworth and as the train slowed
down for the station, the conductor came back
and spoke to Bob.</p>
<p>“We’ll be here about fifteen minutes. That
ought to give you time enough to get something
to eat. Restaurant’s right back of the station.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Bob estimated that Ainsworth must be a village
of some two hundred souls and he was dubious
about the quality of the food which he would obtain,
but when he stepped inside the eating house
he was agreeably surprised by the cleanliness and
an elderly woman took his order with pleasing
promptness.</p>
<p>Bob took a cold cereal, and ate it with relish
while eggs and bacon sputtered on a stove in the
kitchen. When they were ready he ordered coffee
and several doughnuts.</p>
<p>“Don’t need to hurry too much, they won’t go
away without you,” reassured the woman who
waited on him.</p>
<p>But Bob finished in ample time to enjoy a
leisurely walk back to the train. When he reentered
the day coach he was surprised to find
another occupant, a large, heavy-boned man with
a faded mustache and thinning hair. What surprised
Bob even more was to see a badge on the
other’s vest and he strolled forward through the
car. His eyes opened a little wider when he saw
that the badge worn by the other said, “Sheriff.”</p>
<p>The water cooler was a convenient place to
stop and Bob, studying the other man in leisure,
drank two cups of water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Suddenly the sheriff spoke.</p>
<p>“Now that you’ve about sized me up, what’s
on your mind, Bud?”</p>
<p>Bob almost fell over backwards for he had tried
to make his observation of the other man altogether
casual.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he managed to reply, but the word
failed to carry conviction.</p>
<p>“Not trying to dodge the law, are you?” asked
the sheriff, and Bob noticed that a perfectly capable
looking gun was holstered under the other’s
right shoulder.</p>
<p>“No,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“Then why are you carrying a gun?”</p>
<p>Bob started, almost guiltily, and his face
flushed.</p>
<p>“That,” he retorted, “is none of your business.”</p>
<p>After the words were out he could almost have
bitten his tongue in two for if the sheriff pressed
him for an answer, he would be forced to reveal
his identity and such things as local sheriffs being
involved in crime was not altogether unknown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>“I’m making it my business right now,”
snapped the older man and before Bob could
move, a gun appeared in the other’s hands.</p>
<p>“Put up your hands and turn around. Do it
slowly and you won’t be hurt, but if you make
one false move, I’ll let you have it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXVII</span></span>
<br>SHERIFF McCURDY TALKS<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>There was nothing else for Bob to do and
with his hands raised high above his head,
he turned slowly and faced the water
cooler. He could imagine how Tully Ross would
have chuckled if he could have seen his predicament
now.</p>
<p>Firm hands whisked the gun out of the
shoulder holster and Bob heard the sheriff step
back.</p>
<p>“Turn around slowly now, but keep your
hands up.”</p>
<p>Bob obeyed the command and the sheriff
waved him toward a seat on the opposite side of
the car.</p>
<p>“Now that you’ve got my gun, you’d better let
me explain,” said Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>“You can do your explaining in jail,” retorted
the sheriff. “No big-town gunman is going to run
another trick on me.”</p>
<p>The last words were said with grim determination
and Bob saw the sheriff’s jaw muscles tighten.</p>
<p>“Turn up the lapel of my coat and you’ll find
that you’re making a mistake,” pressed Bob. “I’m
an agent of the bureau of investigation of the
United States Department of Justice.”</p>
<p>“You’re just a kid,” scoffed the older officer.</p>
<p>“Turn up the lapel of my coat and see what’s
there. This thing has gone far enough,” insisted
Bob.</p>
<p>There was something in Bob’s voice which
forced the sheriff to act and he reached over
cautiously and turned up the lapel of Bob’s coat.
The small badge which was revealed there
brought an instant change in his attitude and he
lowered the gun which he held in his hands.</p>
<p>“Looks like I’ve made a bad mistake,” he said.
“I’m sorry, but after what I’ve been through you
can’t blame me.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>The sheriff, who introduced himself as Abel
McCurdy, handed the gun back to Bob and the
federal agent, after breaking open the gun and
looking at the chambers, returned it to his
shoulder holster.</p>
<p>“What’s happened?” asked Bob, for he recalled
that only a minute earlier the sheriff hinted
at some trick of which he had been the victim.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s kind of a crazy story and I don’t suppose
it would interest a federal man,” replied the
older officer.</p>
<p>“I’m interested in anything that’s going on
around here,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“Then you may run right smack into trouble,”
cautioned the other, and he shook his head a little
sadly. “That’s what was the matter with
me—too interested in other people’s business.”</p>
<p>“Tell me what happened,” pressed Bob, for he
had a feeling that in some way or another the
sheriff might be connected with the smugglers
who were known to be operating around Atalissa.</p>
<p>“There’s been some strange things going on
along the coast,” began the sheriff, “and I’ve been
trying to figure them out, but I didn’t have much
luck until last night when I was south of Atalissa.
A big touring car came roaring along the road and
I stopped it. Car was going too fast.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>“What happened?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Too much,” admitted the sheriff. “Fellow
driving got out, but when he did he had a machine
gun in his hands and I wasn’t any match for that
even though I’m a pretty good shot with a revolver.
He handcuffed me with my own handcuffs
and made me get into the back seat and then
drove off like mad. After a while he stopped and
blindfolded me, and then went on for a time.”</p>
<p>“What did he look like?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Well, he was kind of short and heavy, I’d
say.” The sheriff went on with his description of
the man who had kidnaped him and before he was
through Bob was convinced that the other was
Joe Hamsa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXVIII</span></span>
<br>THEORIES<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob felt it was time to reveal his real mission
to the seacoast and in clear, brief words he
told the sheriff why he had come down
from Washington and what had gone on since he
had started south.</p>
<p>“You mean to say they had the nerve to kidnap
your uncle, a federal agent?” asked the sheriff.</p>
<p>“I’m sure they have him and the only thing we
know is that the start away from Jacksonville was
made by boat.”</p>
<p>The sheriff nodded.</p>
<p>“That would be a good way. Why, I can think
of half a hundred good places to hide a man along
this section of the coast.” Then the sheriff went
on to explain that shortly before dawn he had
been dumped unceremoniously out of the sedan
after being released from the handcuffs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>“Can you remember any stops?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Only one. We must have been very close to
the ocean, for I was sure I could hear the sound of
the surf.”</p>
<p>“Any idea in what direction you traveled?”</p>
<p>“Nothing that would help much. I was about
two miles from Ainsworth when I was dumped
out, and I went in there and got another gun and
then decided to take the train to Atalissa for I
was only about a mile from there when I was
kidnaped last night.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear anything unusual when you
stopped where you thought you could hear the
surf?” pressed on Bob.</p>
<p>Sheriff McCurdy was silent for a time.</p>
<p>“Yes, there was one thing—a humming that was
faint and then increased in strength and finally
died away.”</p>
<p>“It might have been a ’plane,” suggested Bob.</p>
<p>“Why, I hadn’t thought of that. Sure, that’s
just what it sounded like.”</p>
<p>“The driver of the car got out and came back
a little after.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>“After the humming had died away?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” agreed the sheriff.</p>
<p>Bob was elated at this news. He felt that even
before his arrival at Atalissa he had stumbled upon
a real clue and he hoped upon a worthy aid in
the doughty southern sheriff.</p>
<p>“Then he went on, later dumping you out of
the car?” pressed Bob.</p>
<p>The sheriff agreed.</p>
<p>“He was none too gentle in dumping me out,”
complained the sheriff. “I’d just like to get my
hands on him for a few minutes. Believe me, I’d
make his bones ache.”</p>
<p>There was no question about the irritation or
the sincerity of the officer and Bob couldn’t help
but suppress a chuckle, for he believed the sheriff
perfectly capable of manhandling Joe Hamsa.</p>
<p>Bob felt that the time had come to be perfectly
frank with the sheriff.</p>
<p>“I’m down here on a smuggling case,” he explained.
“I’m going to need your help and I may
need it badly.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Then he went on to relate in detail everything
that had taken place since he had left Washington,
revealing even the kidnaping of his uncle.
When he was through the sheriff whistled
through his whiskers.</p>
<p>“I’ve kind of suspected that something queer
was going on south of Atalissa, but there were no
complaints and I never was able to pick up anything.
You think the fellow who kidnaped me
was the man on the train with you when you
came south?”</p>
<p>“From your description, I’m positive it was
Hamsa,” replied Bob.</p>
<p>“Then he’s a tough customer if he escaped
from that river and got down here so rapidly.”</p>
<p>“One thing we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Bob, “is that the gang is compact and apparently
extremely well organized.”</p>
<p>The sheriff was silent for a time.</p>
<p>“Think that plane landing last night might have
brought in smuggled gems?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>“I don’t know,” confessed Bob. “Everyone in
the department has a feeling that the gang is pointing
toward one more big smuggling operation.
If the gems had come in last night I have a feeling
that more than one man would have been with
Hamsa to get them. It just doesn’t seem logical
that one man, even though he might be the leader
of the gang, would handle this end of the game. I’d
be more inclined to think the contact last night
was for the purpose of making final plans.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXIX</span></span>
<br>MORE CLUES<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>The sheriff turned this over in his mind
for some time as the train rumbled along
the rough right-of-way. Then he nodded
and agreed with Bob.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’re right. That means we may
be in for a busy time when the actual contact is
attempted.”</p>
<p>“We’ll be busy enough, if we can learn where
the contact will be made,” retorted the young
federal agent.</p>
<p>“What about your uncle?” asked the sheriff.</p>
<p>The exultation which had marked Bob’s features
vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>“I don’t honestly know. From the reputation
of this gang I should fear the worst, but for some
reason I have unbounded faith in my uncle’s
ability to take care of himself in a crisis. The last
we knew was that he disappeared from the waterfront
and shortly after that a motorboat sped
down the river.”</p>
<p>“Then if a big smuggling operation is under
way, it’s just possible that he might be brought
down here,” argued the sheriff.</p>
<p>“He might be taken to their hideout,” agreed
Bob, “but so far our men have no real clue to
that.”</p>
<p>“We may be able to pick up something at Atalissa,”
said the sheriff. “I’ve a number of friends
there who may be able to give me information you
never could get.”</p>
<p>As the accommodation jogged toward the
coast, the country became wilder and they
rumbled across narrow bridges that spanned
bayous and salt streams. Undergrowth was thick
and almost jungle-like. They were in one of the
wildest sections of the Florida coast—uninviting,
inhospitable, and for years the hideout for lawbreakers
of various kinds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>The brakes went on sharply and the little
train swung around a curve as the wheels shrieked
a protest. Looking ahead, Bob could see a huddle
of houses around a large bayou. Beyond that was
a narrow opening and further out a glimpse of the
blue Atlantic. This, then, must be Atalissa, his
present destination.</p>
<p>The sheriff stood up, and looked at his watch.</p>
<p>“Lucky trip this morning,” he declared. “Usually
the local has a couple of derailments.”</p>
<p>The train pulled up before a dilapidated station
and Bob and the sheriff stepped down on a rough
plank platform. The only others visible were the
train crew and the station agent.</p>
<p>“Town looks quiet,” said the sheriff as they
started down the one street which was flanked on
one side by the clear waters of the bayou and on
the other by a long line of buildings, some of
them stores and the others places of residence.</p>
<p>The first building, a story and a half structure,
was a barber shop and the sheriff turned in here.</p>
<p>“Morning, sheriff,” said the barber.</p>
<p>“Morning, Emil,” replied the sheriff. “Want
you to meet a friend of mine, Bob Houston.
Northerner. He’s down for a few days loafing
and maybe a little fishing. Know anything new?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>The barber, inclined to stoutness and baldness,
shook his head.</p>
<p>“Not even any good fishing left,” he sighed.</p>
<p>“Everybody behavin’?” asked the sheriff.</p>
<p>“Just what are you driving at?” the barber
asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing special; just thought you might have
heard of something,” grinned the sheriff.</p>
<p>“Matter of fact, I have,” retorted the barber.
“Somebody’s been flying around here the last
couple of nights with a plane of some kind.”</p>
<p>“That ain’t so unusual, is it?” asked the sheriff.
“We’ve been used to all kinds of things along this
coast.”</p>
<p>“Well, that wasn’t so strange, but this morning
when I was fishing down in Harpey’s bayou a
boat came through there so fast it was nothing
but a black streak and a flash of spray. Blamed
thing must have been doing forty an hour.”</p>
<p>Bob’s eyes glinted.</p>
<p>“Where did it go?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>“Now I was only in a rowboat and I wouldn’t
know where a speed boat went,” replied the barber.
Then, seeing the chagrin on Bob’s face, he
added, “I’d almost be willing to bet that it was
heading for Lost Island.”</p>
<p>Bob saw a queer expression flit across the
sheriff’s face.</p>
<p>“I might have known that’s where such a boat
would be going,” he groaned. “Why couldn’t it
be toward some other island?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know,” grinned the barber, who
sensed that the sheriff was in Atalissa on some important
mission. Bob saw the barber scanning his
coat and he wondered if the gun in the shoulder
holster was visible. If it was, it would reveal instantly
that he was an officer, and not the vacationer
that the sheriff had pictured him to be.</p>
<p>“Guess we’ll be getting a boat and heading
south,” said the sheriff. “Just don’t say anything
to anyone else on what you saw this morning.”</p>
<p>“Not a word, sheriff,” said the barber, and they
left the small shop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>“Queer fellow,” nodded the sheriff as they proceeded
down the street toward a wharf. “He
knows everything that’s going on and he protects
a lot of people, but when some outsiders
come in and start breaking the law, I can always
figure he’ll tell me the truth.”</p>
<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“I’d say that the more men you can get in here,
the better it will be. Emil knows something queer
is going on at Lost Island and it was just his way
of telling me to get there in a hurry. But I don’t
like that place. It’s too lonesome and it’s so big a
man can get lost on it for days.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know there were any islands that
large along here,” replied Bob.</p>
<p>“It isn’t actually an island,” explained the
sheriff, “but there’s water on three sides of it and
it’s swampy and about as dismal as the last place
on earth. Always been a favorite hiding place for
men trying to get away from the law.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXX</span></span>
<br>READY FOR ACTION<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>At the wharf the sheriff dickered for the
rental of a boat and a 20-foot craft with
a sturdy four cylinder motor was secured.
There was nothing speedy about it, but
it looked eminently safe.</p>
<p>“We may be gone a couple of nights. I know
where I can get some duffel and grub. You’d better
send word for more of your men to get in
here,” said the sheriff, and while he went in quest
of the camping supplies, Bob walked back to the
station.</p>
<p>He had been warned to use extreme caution
in sending out any messages from Atalissa, but
there was no time to drive to another town and
he preferred to telegraph rather than to telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The message went in code and it took him some
time to compose it. Very briefly he outlined what
he had learned from the sheriff, concluding,
“Now believe Merritt Hughes has been brought
to Lost Island and that attempt to bring in large
amount of gems will be made soon.”</p>
<p>Bob did not leave the old depot until the telegram
was humming over the wires on its way to
Washington. Then he returned to the wharf and
found the sheriff waiting.</p>
<p>“We’ll start at once,” said the officer. “I’ve got
a snack put up for our lunch and we’ll eat on
the way. Save time.”</p>
<p>Bob stepped into the bow of the boat where
the sheriff had stowed away the federal agent’s
large bag and the officer jumped into the stern.
The motor was turning over smoothly. The
sheriff threw in the clutch and they moved away.</p>
<p>The young federal agent looked back at the
sleepy village which was strung along the bayou.
The barber came out of his shop and waved at
them and the man on the wharf, from whom they
had rented the boat, watched them, his hands
shielding his eyes from the glaring rays of the
mid-day sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Sheriff McCurdy headed the boat toward the
seaway, but before they reached it swung it
sharply to the right and they chugged through a
narrow passageway that twisted and turned interminably.</p>
<p>“How under the sun can you find your way
through all this maze of channels?” asked Bob,
understanding now why it was an ideal spot to
carry on smuggling operations.</p>
<p>“Been in this country all my life,” explained
the sheriff, “but once in a while I get lost. Then
I usually just sit still until someone hunts me up.”</p>
<p>A larger expanse of water opened ahead of
them.</p>
<p>“Harpey’s bayou,” said the sheriff. “This is
where Emil was fishing when that black speed
boat came through.”</p>
<p>The sheriff put the rudder bar between his legs
and unwrapped a package which had been resting
on the floor boards in the bottom of the boat.
Inside were half a dozen thick sandwiches, heavily
laden with butter and with generous slices of cold
ham between the bread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>They ate the sandwiches as the launch chugged
through the quiet waters of Harpey’s bayou.</p>
<p>The sheriff produced a jug of cold water and
after a deep drink apiece, they nosed the boat
out of the bayou and into another twisting channel,
which, while deep, was heavily overgrown
with trees which arched above the water until
they formed a perfect tunnel.</p>
<p>The air was cool and dank and Bob shuddered
involuntarily as he thought of the loneliness
which would descend upon such an area when the
sun went down.</p>
<p>“How far is it to Lost Island?” he asked the
sheriff.</p>
<p>“Depends on just which part we’re going to.
The nearest point is about eight miles from here.”</p>
<p>They went on for some distance without speaking,
the sheriff devoting practically all of his time
to watching the channel.</p>
<p>A little more than half an hour later he shut off
the engine and skillfully guided the boat into a
backwater where they would not be visible from
the main channel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Sheriff McCurdy dropped the heavy piece of
iron which served as an anchor overboard and
Bob was surprised to note that the water was at
least eight or nine feet deep.</p>
<p>“Better look over your guns. We may need
them in a hurry,” advised the sheriff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXI</span></span>
<br>A BOAT FLASHES PAST<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Bob got out his Gladstone bag and opened it,
removing the case which held his rifle.</p>
<p>He assembled the gun and filled the
magazine with shells. Placing it against his
shoulder, he aimed at a spot some distance away
when a sharp call from the sheriff stopped the
steady pressure of his finger on the trigger.</p>
<p>“Don’t take any chances with a shot now giving
an alarm to anyone,” he warned. “Remember
that the men who hide out down here are all wary
of any gunshots.”</p>
<p>Bob lowered the gun and he knew that his
cheeks were burning for, had he thought of the
possible result, he would not have attempted a
practice shot or two.</p>
<p>The sheriff, probing his own roll of duffel,
unearthed a serviceable looking gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>“Borrowed this from the barber,” he grinned.
“It isn’t quite as fancy a gun as yours but it will
carry well and I’ve used it once or twice before,
so I’m used to handling it.”</p>
<p>The sheriff drew out his pipe and lighted it,
settling back against the gunwale.</p>
<p>“Aren’t we going on?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“Not much use right now,” replied the officer.
“We’d be spotted in a minute. We’ll wait until
dusk. Then we can cruise along the island.
They’ll be sure to have a fire of some kind for the
nights are getting chilly.”</p>
<p>Bob knew that the sheriff was right, but the
thought of inactivity while his uncle was in the
hands of gangsters galled his active spirit. However,
he made the best of it and tried to doze.</p>
<p>An hour slipped away when the exhaust of a
motorboat, evidently coming at high speed,
echoed through the lowlands.</p>
<p>The sheriff sat up quickly, glanced at his rifle,
and then picked up an oar and paddled their boat
closer toward a thicket so that they were well
hidden from the channel which passed within a
short distance of the bayou where they had
sought temporary refuge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>The noise of the oncoming boat was clearer.</p>
<p>“Coming fast,” grunted the sheriff, balancing
his rifle in his hands.</p>
<p>Bob, crouched in the bow, saw a gray boat
shoot into sight in the main channel. It was not
more than 200 feet away and only one man was
in the boat. With a start he recognized the
crouched figure of Joe Hamsa. Then the gray
speeder was gone, only a broad, spreading wake
remaining to mark its passage.</p>
<p>The federal agent turned to the sheriff.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to follow him. That was Joe
Hamsa.”</p>
<p>The sheriff shook his head.</p>
<p>“We’re not following him now; still too light.
Besides I know he’s headed for the island. Listen
to him go!”</p>
<p>The roar of the exhaust gradually died away
and the sheriff turned to Bob.</p>
<p>“You’re sure that was your man?”</p>
<p>“Positive,” replied Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Sheriff McCurdy looked at his borrowed rifle
once more and Bob saw the deep lines of the peace
officer’s face tighten.</p>
<p>They remained for another hour in the seclusion
of the small bayou and before they started
out again the shadows were deepening and the
warmth of the afternoon was vanishing.</p>
<p>Sheriff McCurdy started the motor of their
boat and Bob pulled up the mud-covered anchor.
With the motor throttle well down they started
for Lost Island and Bob was thankful that their
boat had an underwater exhaust which it was almost
impossible to hear.</p>
<p>After leaving the shelter of the bayou, Sheriff
McCurdy operated their boat with extreme caution
and just before they came within sight of
Lost Island he stopped the boat and spoke to Bob.</p>
<p>“We may be poking our heads into a hornet’s
nest,” he warned. “Want to go on or wait until
additional federal men can get to Atalissa and we
can bring them down here?”</p>
<p>“That might be too late,” decided Bob. “We’ll
go on.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>The sheriff started the motor and once more
they were in forward motion, the bow of their
small boat knifing its way through the waters of
a larger lagoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXII</span></span>
<br>LOST ISLAND AHEAD<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Ahead of them lay a long, low mass of
tangled undergrowth.</p>
<p>“Lost Island,” said the sheriff cryptically
and Bob felt his blood beating faster. It
was toward this spot that the black speed boat
sighted by the barber had been going and it was
also toward this spot that Joe Hamsa had been
hurrying in the gray motorboat.</p>
<p>The motor of their own boat died suddenly and
Bob looked toward the sheriff, whose face was
still dimly discernible in the faint light.</p>
<p>“No more noise; we’ll use oars from now on.”</p>
<p>Bob helped put the oars in their sockets. There
were two pairs and they bent their backs to the
task of rowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>“This may be an all night job,” grunted the
sheriff, “but it will be worth it if I can catch up
with the fellow who threw me out of the car last
night.”</p>
<p>The boat, although not large, was heavy and in
less than half an hour Bob had blisters on both
hands and his back ached mightily.</p>
<p>“Ease up a bit,” advised the sheriff. “We’ll
drift along here and rest.”</p>
<p>Bob welcomed the chance to straighten up and
he let the oars rest in the oarlocks while he stood
up in the boat.</p>
<p>A flicker of light to the left caught his eye
and he spoke quietly to the sheriff.</p>
<p>“There’s a light to your left,” he said. “Stand
up and look at it.”</p>
<p>Sheriff McCurdy stood up in the stern.</p>
<p>“I expected something like this,” he grunted.
“Might as well rest a bit, though, for I’ve too
many kinks in my back now to think of a good
scrap.”</p>
<p>The boat drifted gently and the sheriff told
what he knew about the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>“This is one of the highest parts,” he explained,
“and one of the driest. Not much swamp right
here and the footing should be good. On the other
side there’s an old pier and a sort of hunting house
that was built years ago by some northerners. I
expect we’ll find the men we want over there.”</p>
<p>Bob was too impatient to rest very long, and
at his insistence, they took up the oars again and
turned the bow of their boat toward shore.</p>
<p>Moving like a shadow and with as little noise,
they guided their craft in toward the island. The
bow stuck in soft mud three or four feet from the
shore and the sheriff grunted his distaste.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to wade in,” he complained. “I’ll
get wet and that will make my rheumatism bad
again.”</p>
<p>Bob dropped their anchor over into the mud
and the sheriff stuck two of the spark plugs from
the motor in his pocket, effectively disabling the
boat from use.</p>
<p>With Bob in the lead, they dropped over the
side. The muck and ooze was cold and slimy and
Bob felt his legs plowing in about six inches of
the clammy stuff. Fortunately they were ashore
in about four long strides.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>They paused long enough to loosen the guns in
their shoulder holsters and to look at the safeties
on their rifles. Then, with the sheriff in the lead,
they started for the far side of the narrow island.</p>
<p>There was plenty of underbrush, but the
ground was firm, and by treading cautiously, they
made progress without making much noise.</p>
<p>From a little knoll which they ascended they
could look down on the other side of the island
and the light which Bob had seen from a distance
was plainly visible.</p>
<p>It was a torch of some kind and was apparently
mounted on a rather tall pole, for the flame flickered
in the light breeze which was sweeping in
from the open sea.</p>
<p>Moving even more cautiously than before,
Bob and the sheriff started down for the camp
which they knew must be in the blackness beyond
the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXIII</span></span>
<br>OUT OF THE NIGHT<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>It was a dismal adventure and it took real
courage to move even another step forward,
but Bob was driven on by the thought that
his uncle might be on the island and that success
tonight would bring about his return and smash
the ring of smugglers he had been assigned to
break up.</p>
<p>As they neared the light it was plain that the
flare was mounted on a pole about twenty feet
tall and Bob stopped the sheriff.</p>
<p>“That looks like a beacon for a plane,” he
muttered.</p>
<p>“If it is, it fits in with your theory that they’ll
land the smuggled gems by plane,” replied Sheriff
McCurdy.</p>
<p>They went on, treading easily and giving the
circle of light cast by the flare a wide birth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Against the blackness of the waters of a broad
bayou which flanked the other side of Lost Island
loomed the outline of a ramshackle structure and
though the windows appeared to be boarded up,
faint rays of light crept through a number of
cracks. Bob half stumbled on a stick and the
noise brought the quick baying of a hound.</p>
<p>“We’re in for it now,” said the sheriff, and Bob
felt that trouble, and serious trouble, was just
ahead.</p>
<p>A door in the house was thrown open and
against the oblong of light could be seen the silhouette
of a man. Then he stepped out into the
night, to be followed by a second man, stockier
and heavier than the first.</p>
<p>“Stay down,” whispered the sheriff. “Maybe
they’ll miss us. We don’t want trouble now.”</p>
<p>Before the men could leave the shelter of the
house, the low drone of an incoming plane could
be heard. Bob turned toward the east. A red and
green light, marking the wing tips of a plane, were
visible. The craft was low and evidently coming
in fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Even above the noise of the plane, they could
hear a shouted command near the old house, and
one of the men who had stepped outside turned
on a flash light and raced toward the pier, some
distance away. He was followed, at a slower
pace by the second man.</p>
<p>“That’s Hamsa, I’m sure,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“Let’s get inside and see if anyone is there,”
said Sheriff McCurdy and they moved around so
that the house was between them and the pier.</p>
<p>Landing lights of the plane blinked on as it
circled over them and once the powerful beams
swept down on the clearing, but Bob and the
Sheriff, anticipating that, had dropped to the
ground behind an old log and were safe, for the
moment, from discovery.</p>
<p>“Must be either a seaplane or an amphibian,”
said Bob as the plane prepared to alight on the
water.</p>
<p>“Get inside,” urged the sheriff, who would
feel better when he had some shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>The two men on the pier were concentrating
their attention on the plane swinging over the
lagoon and the hound which had sounded the
alarm was beside them, so it was a comparatively
simple matter for Bob to jump across the
threshold.</p>
<p>Inside the door, where only an oil lamp cast
faint illumination, he crouched with his rifle in
his hands, accustoming his eyes to the light. There
was, apparently, no one in the room.</p>
<p>He spoke softly to the sheriff, who was waiting
just outside.</p>
<p>“All clear; come on!”</p>
<p>With one bound the sheriff was inside and like
Bob he had his rifle ready for instant action.</p>
<p>Squinting between cracks in the wall, the
sheriff watched the action in the lagoon. The
plane smacked the surface of the water sharply
and came to rest several hundred feet from the
end of the old pier. The men waiting there put
out in a motorboat, making directly for the
plane, which was bobbing around on the waves
which it had stirred up in the quiet waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXIV</span></span>
<br>IN THE SHANTY<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Sheriff McCurdy turned from the wall and
watched Bob open the door to the second
room. He saw the young federal agent
drop to his knees and his gun clatter while a
choked sob escaped from Bob’s lips.</p>
<p>The sheriff crossed the room in several bounds
and bent down over Bob, who was kneeling beside
the bound and gagged figure of a man.</p>
<p>Without asking questions, the sheriff handed
Bob a knife and the ropes and gag were slashed.</p>
<p>“Uncle Merritt, Uncle Merritt,” cried Bob.
“Speak to me.” There was desperation in his
voice.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes opened his eyes and tried to
smile. His lips and tongue were swollen from the
gag, but the expression in his eyes gave Bob
courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>“We’d better get him out of here,” said Bob.
“They’ll be back and we won’t be ready for
them.”</p>
<p>Before they could turn, a harsh laugh echoed
through the room and the heavy voice of Joe
Hamsa lashed at them.</p>
<p>“You’re not going any place, boys, except
where I want you to and you’ll never return
from there.”</p>
<p>Bob started to move, but a quick command
from Hamsa stopped him.</p>
<p>“Don’t move kid. I’ve got a machine gun on
you and my finger is nervous. Turn around
slowly and don’t either one of you try any gunplay.”</p>
<p>They started to turn slowly when Bob was
amazed by a quick gesture of his uncle’s. Hidden
in the heavy shadow of the little room which adjoined
the larger one, he reached up and like a
flash seized the revolver which was in the shoulder
holster. There wasn’t even the rustle of Bob’s
coat as the gun was whisked away and Bob continued
to turn slowly toward Hamsa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>The man who had claimed to be a diamond
salesman was standing in the doorway, a machine
gun in his hands. Behind him was a man with a
scar, whom Bob recognized from the descriptions
obtained in Jacksonville must have been the abductor
of his uncle. To the rear of these two was
a slender chap, little older than Bob and with a
thin face. He was in a flyer’s outfit and in his
hands carried a soft leather case.</p>
<p>“Get their guns, Rap,” barked Hamsa, and
the man with the scar came forward, his hands
patting the sheriff for weapons. The gun was
taken from the shoulder holster and the rifle was
tossed across the room.</p>
<p>The man known as Rap then turned to Bob
and his hands found the empty holster.</p>
<p>“Gun’s gone,” said Rap flatly and without expression.</p>
<p>“Where?” demanded Hamsa.</p>
<p>“Lost in the brush,” fibbed Bob.</p>
<p>The answer seemed to satisfy them and Rap
took the rifle from Bob’s hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>“Take this gun and keep those fellows covered
while Curt and I check over the stuff he brought
in,” ordered Hamsa, handing his weapon to Rap
while the fellow, whom he had called Curt, strode
into the room and placed his black leather case on
the rough table.</p>
<p>Bob gasped as the velvet lined case was opened
and scores of gleaming diamonds were revealed.
A king’s fortune was spread on the table in front
of them and Hamsa, an ugly light in his eyes,
looked at his captives.</p>
<p>“So you federal men thought you were smart
enough for Joe Hamsa?” he chortled. “Well, this
is your last assignment. You’ve seen me and
you’ve seen how we bring in the stuff. This is my
last job. I’ll make a cool million on it. Think it
over.”</p>
<p>He turned back to the pile of gems and ran
them through his stubby fingers, gloating at the
wealth that was on the table.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do now?” asked Curt.</p>
<p>“Sink your plane and the gray boat. We’ll use
the black one for a getaway and we’ll burn this
place before we leave.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>“How about the federal men?” The flyer
gestured toward Bob and the others.</p>
<p>“Maybe we’ll sink them, too,” said Hamsa and
there was deadly mirth in his words.</p>
<p>The man known as Rap started to laugh, but
a sharp explosion back of Bob turned the laugh
into a sob and Rap, gasping for breath, sank to
the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXV</span></span>
<br>REVERSING THE TABLES<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>Hamsa whirled toward the officers, a gun
in his right hand. Before he could use it,
there was another explosion and Hamsa
reeled back against the wall, his right arm hanging
limp and useless, the gun which it had held falling
to the floor.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!” The command was low and
husky, but there was authority in the words and
Bob, out of the corner of one eye, saw his uncle
step out of the small room to the rear. From this
position of advantage he had disabled Rap, the
machine gunner, and wounded Hamsa. Curt, the
flyer, had his hands in the air.</p>
<p>“Pick up their guns, Bob,” commanded his
uncle and Bob picked up the machine gun and the
revolver Hamsa had dropped.</p>
<p>“Search them!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>This time the sheriff stepped forward and with
hands long experienced in that kind of work,
searched even the hats of the others. A gun was
taken from the flyer and a stubby but deadly
pistol from Rap. These were placed on the table
beside the glittering pile of diamonds.</p>
<p>“Got any handcuffs, sheriff?” asked Bob’s
uncle after the young federal agent introduced
his ally.</p>
<p>Two small, compact pairs were produced from
the capacious pockets of the peace officer. One
pair was snapped on Hamsa and the other on
Curt and Rap.</p>
<p>While Bob and his uncle went about the task
of giving first aid to Rap and Hamsa, the sheriff
went down to the old wharf to inspect the boats.</p>
<p>When he returned, the bandaging was done,
for neither wound was serious.</p>
<p>“We can start any time you want to,” he informed
the federal men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>“Take these fellows down. We’ll be along
shortly,” replied Merritt Hughes, and when
Hamsa and his allies had been led away by the
sheriff, he sat down on one side of the table and
motioned for Bob to take a seat opposite him.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear your side of the story, Bob,” said
his uncle as he sat down, massaging the red marks
which the tightly tied ropes had made on his
hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<h2 id="c36"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXVI</span></span>
<br>UNTANGLING THE WEB<br><span class="smaller">★</span></h2>
<p>It was a strange setting, the rays from the
kerosene lamp on the table throwing a soft
glow over the diamonds which were still
heaped on the black velvet.</p>
<p>Bob was anxious to tell his own story, but first
he wanted to know about his uncle.</p>
<p>“Sure you’re all right?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, my arms and legs are still a little numb
and I can’t talk any too well, but I’m coming
around fast now.”</p>
<p>Bob launched into a detailed explanation of all
of the events which had taken place since the disappearance
of his uncle in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>“Luckiest thing that ever happened to me was
when I ran into the sheriff,” he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>“No doubt about it,” agreed his uncle. Then he
went on, “The men we captured tonight are the
brains of the gang. From what Hamsa said after
he got here this afternoon I gathered that two
more members of the gang were picked up by
you and Condon Adams last night.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Bob. “But I can’t figure
out how Hamsa got down here so soon and I
thought he’d never get out of the river he fell
into on the way down from Washington.”</p>
<p>“Hamsa is a tough customer,” said Merritt
Hughes. “He has a tremendous physique and was
able to swim to shore. Then he chartered a private
plane and came south.”</p>
<p>“They’ve been running in the diamonds by
plane all the time,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“Curt has been their pilot. He’s got a fast
amphibian and last night he made contact with
Hamsa near Atalissa and informed him that a
large consignment would be delivered tonight.
They were careful to make only the contacts
with the smuggled gems here to keep suspicions
away from this island.”</p>
<p>“Where did Curt get the gems?” Bob wanted
to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>“They were brought over from Europe aboard
tramp steamers. Curt would contact the ships well
off the coast and then fly the smuggled stuff in at
night. They were careful about the type of gems
they brought in. Why these diamonds on the table
could be sold almost any place without suspicion.
In fact, Hamsa actually went around the country
peddling them to customers who had no idea that
they were smuggled property.”</p>
<p>Bob, leaning back in his chair, looked at his
uncle.</p>
<p>“You must have been brought directly here,”
he said.</p>
<p>“Just as fast as the fellow they call Rap could
get me here. Hamsa had been in Washington.
Somehow he got wind that Department of Justice
men were being put on his trail and he learned
that Adams and I had been sent south. It was up
to Rap to get us out of the way. Then Hamsa
came down and it was just luck that he met you
and Tully on the train. What looked like a bad
situation for us turned out all right.”</p>
<p>Bob chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>“Won’t Tully be sore when he learns that the
whole case has been cleared up without him getting
even as far as Jacksonville.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t worry about Tully, Bob. This is
another feather in your cap. Just keep plugging
away and you’ll get toward the top in the Department
mighty fast.”</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes bent down and gathered up
the smuggled gems, wrapping them in the velvet
and replacing them in the leather case.</p>
<p>“We might as well destroy this place so that it
will no longer be used for such purposes,” he said,
and as he stepped out of the door behind Bob he
aimed a shot at the kerosene lamp. A sheet of
flame spread through the interior of the shanty
and the dry wood crackled lustily as the fire ate
into it.</p>
<p>The glow of the burning shanty illuminated
the clearing and they found their way easily to
the old wharf where Sheriff McCurdy and his
prisoners were waiting for them. Further out the
amphibian was drifting at its anchor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>“We’ll have to leave that for another trip,”
smiled Merritt Hughes. “Sheriff, let’s start for
town. I’m hungry and sleepy.”</p>
<p>With their three captives in the bow, Bob and
his uncle just behind them and the sheriff at the
wheel at the rear, they started out of the bayou,
another successful chapter written in the bureau
of investigation’s war on crime.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
